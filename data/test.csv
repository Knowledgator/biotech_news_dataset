A Renton, Washington-based investor has purchased a building occupied by Vivacity Care Center in Spokane Valley.
Spokane Valley Clinic LLC, whose principal is Soyam Vahora, CEO of Renton-based Aamir Stations, bought the building for $7.7 million earlier this month from Spokane investor John Pariseau, according to Spokane County Assessors Office records.
Premera Blue Cross and Vera Whole Health opened the 12,000-square-foot Vivacity Care Center, at 16009 E. Indiana Ave., last year, marking the third location in the Spokane area.
The center is part of Premeras plan to expand advanced primary care services in Spokane. Premera and Vera Whole Health opened the first Vivacity Care Center at 9001 N. Country Homes Blvd. in January 2020.
Clayton J. Brown, Christopher Edwards and Ruthanne Romero, investment specialists in commercial real estate brokerage Marcus & Millichaps Seattle office, represented the seller.
Vahora was not immediately available for comment on the purchase.
Premera Blue Cross holds a long-term lease for the Vivacity Care Center in the building, according to a Marcus & Millichap company release.
Premera Blue Cross did not respond to a request for comment on its lease agreement with Vahora.
Mountlake Terrace-based Premera Blue Cross is a nonprofit independent licensee of the Blue Cross Blue Shield Association. It provides health benefits and services to more than 2 million people.

2,The 2018 Farm Bill Federally Legalizes Hemp & CBD Products,"relation to marijuana
. While importing hemp products from abroad to the USA was allowed assuming a zero-THC tolerance level, all legal hemp farming ceased that year.
Thanks largely in part to media coverage surrounding CBD's effective use as a treatment for childhood epilepsy, 2013 marked the next important point in hemp history. In that year Colorado farmers began growing hemp under the veil of legal cannabis in the state to feed the growing demand for hemp-sourced CBD oil.
Fast forward a year and the 2014 Farm Bill introduced legislation that allowed states to license growers to produce hemp with limited amounts of the
psychoactive cannabinoid Delta-9 THC
. This bill brought with it a slowly growing number of participating states and allowed for the growing CBD industry to operate within a legal grey area, despite hemp and CBD oil still being considered illegal at the federal level.
Under the 2014 farm bill, the hemp-fueled CBD industry exploded. Growers in participating states and abroad provided plant material for manufacturers to process and ultimately be distributed by retailers. This growth was not without friction though as states and the FDA cracked down on local and online CBD retailers.
Despite CBD products becoming widely available online and locally, the dated CSA still classified these products as illegal. This forced businesses across the industry into a 'high risk' category and removing access from federal systems like banking, credit card processing, advertising platforms and more.
The 2018 Farm Bill Federally Legalizes Hemp
The hemp-related content of the newest Farm Bill is small compared to the entirety of the wide-reaching, 800+ page legislation that focuses on everything that goes into putting food on our plates. While small in length, the new hemp regulations found in the bill are significant in their impact.

7,Cloudy conditions have returned; severe weather likely tomorrow,"Cloudy conditions have returned; severe weather likely tomorrow
March 22, 2022
Aaron Lowery
,
MACON, Georgia (41NBC/WMGT) Cloudy skies are back around Middle Georgia as a new storm system approaches from the west.
Today
A thin layer of clouds filled in over much of the Peach State overnight. This has resulted in much warmer temperatures to begin the day. We will continue to see mostly cloudy conditions today as a layer of high level clouds remains over the region. There may be a few pockets of sunshine, but sunny conditions will likely not be sustained. Highs this afternoon will reach the upper 70s and lower 80s despite the cloud cover. This is largely being driven by southeasterly winds at about 10-15 mph. Gusts could reach speeds upwards of 20 mph today as well. Rain, however, is unlikely during the daylight hours today.
The cloud cover will thicken up a bit more overnight as some lower level clouds build in. Wind speeds will remain at about 10-15 mph however gusts are likely to increase up to speeds of 25-30 mph, still out of the south-southeast. This will keep lows very warm rolling into tomorrow morning, allowing them to only fall into the low to mid 60s. With rain likely moving in ahead of the sunrise tomorrow and severe weather potentially on the horizon tomorrow afternoon, lows could be as warm as the mid to upper 60s. Severe weather is not expected to move in ahead of the sunrise tomorrow at this time.
Tomorrow
Accompanying a very warm start to the day will be some moderate to heavy rain with some thunderstorms. Youll want an umbrella out the door as there will be plenty of rain chances tomorrow with the first wave arriving early and a second around lunchtime. Its that second wave that is bringing the severe weather threat as temperatures climb back into the low to mid 70s. Winds will continue to come in from the south and south-southeast at about 15-20 mph with gusts in excess of 30 mph possible ahead of afternoon storm activity.
The severe weather threat is a Level 2 Slight for all counties in Middle Georgia at this time. This could elevate into a Level 3 Enhanced risk ahead of tomorrow morning. As of now the main risks look to be strong winds and heavy rain, but the tornado threat looks higher than in previous systems. Winds at the surface will be from the south/south-southeast but winds about 1km above the surface will be out of the southwest at 50-80 mph. This hints at the possibility of high levels of low-level shear (change of wind direction and speed with height) which favors a higher tornado threat. If that doesnt pan out, those winds that are 1km aloft could also be brought down to the surface by heavy downbursts of rain. These very powerful straight-line wind gusts could blow over trees and power lines causing property damage.
The storms will subside in the late afternoon hours, leaving mostly cloudy conditions rolling into tomorrow night. A few showers will be possible around the region tomorrow night as the cloud cover remains overhead. The wind should also slow down to under 15 mph as it shifts more towards the west overnight. Lows will cool a bit from Tuesday night back into the mid 50s.
Thursday and Beyond
Some sunshine is likely to return on Thursday however a few isolated showers will also be possible in the afternoon. Those will just be an after-effect of the storm system as it continues to push northeast.
Friday will see the return of more sun but scattered clouds are likely to develop in the afternoon. Rain is unlikely with these clouds.
Overall sunny conditions along with strong breezes will dominate the weekend, especially on Saturday.

8,It was a very peaceful country: Punjab AAP MLA recalls her years in Ukraine as a medical student,"Click here for more
The MLAs husband and siblings are also medical graduates from Ukraine. Her husband Dr Rakesh Arora, who is now a government medical officer in Moga, was her university senior, while her sister Dr Harmanpreet Kaur graduated from the Luhansk State Medical University in the disputed Donbas region in eastern Ukraine. Her brother Dr Baljinder Singh graduated from the Uzhhorod National Medical University in west Ukraine.
https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png
Dr Amandeep Kaur Aroras husband was her college senior in Crimea. Her brother and sister too studied in Ukraine. (Express Photo)
The legislator has fond memories of her time in the east European country. Unlike India, medical students do not face any ragging or harassment there. Senior students and teachers are very friendly and helpful. It was a very peaceful country and the people were very friendly. Here, we get tired of paying for extra tuition, but there the teachers take extra classes in the evening to clarify doubts. Compulsions make students leave our country. They wont if the system here is good enough and if it is possible for a common student to afford medical education, she tells The Indian Express
Given her background, Dr Amandeep understands why Indian medical degree aspirants travel to Ukraine.
In my time, private medical colleges asked for donations of Rs 30-40 lakh straightaway in one go and tuition fee was extra. In Ukraine, it cost Rs 30 lakh. When I hear stories of Ukraine returnees today, I feel the situation is still the same. Medical education is far beyond the reach of students and those from middle class or poor families cannot even think of becoming doctors. Medical education in Ukraine costs almost half of what it does in India, she says.
The MLA is from the village of Chandumajra in Rajpura. Her father is a retired Army officer while her mother is a homemaker. A student from a poor family cannot even think of becoming a doctor in India. Though I belonged to a Jatt Sikh family that owns agricultural land, I had two more siblings. Here, the expense might have touched Rs 1 crore. In Ukraine, we spent around Rs 30 lakh. Moreover, there were no MBBS seats here and I got a seat in dentistry in Punjab. I got a seat In Patna (Bihar) too, but my parents thought it would be unsafe there. Also, there were so many other formalities such as buying a piece of land, getting a ration card made in Bihar etc that made us choose Ukraine.
During a cleanliness drive in Moga
Calling on the Central government to help medical students who have returned from Ukraine, Dr Amandeep says, It is not their fault that the war started. Final-year students must be given their degrees after taking online exams by Ukrainian universities because otherwise they wont be able to appear for FMGE and their year will be wasted. For others, the government must try to adjust them in colleges here because parents cant put the lives of their children in danger by sending them back. Our government in Punjab and Delhi will try to do the best possible for them.
She adds, If we want our students to stay here, we need more seats, more medical colleges, and a fee regulatory law to stop the exploitation of students by private colleges. For Ukraine medical graduates, it has never been easy. The FMGE test is too tough and most questions are of postgraduate level.",Accentus Medical,other,,,,

11,Laurel battling issues with cooking grease in the drains,"Share on LinkedIn
LAUREL, Miss. (WDAM) - The City of Laurel recently announced a big problem with clogged drains.
Brent Shelby is the project manager for Suez, the City of Laurels water contract operator. He says, the company has been dealing with a lot of sewer stop-ups caused by things some people are putting down their drains.
One of the biggest things that were seeing right now is that were fighting a heavy amount of grease that is in the lines, and were seeing these in our lift stations which causes a pump failure. It causes mains to back of it causes sewer services for the customers to back up says Shelby.
When this happens, it takes a lot of manpower to fix the issue and it is not a cheap fix.
It costs a lot of money. The taxpayers they see it, the customers they see it. It costs a lot of money on our equipment. Between our jet truck between labor, over time, it costs money on keeping our pumps going, says Shelby.
Shelby says pouring cooking grease down the drain can create problems for everybody in your neighborhood.
Youre stopping up your service line and stopping up everybodys service line and youre also causing a lot of maintenance issues on the collection system, says Shelby.
Shelby says restaurants should make sure their grease traps are clean and residents should practice putting their grease into a disposable container and throwing it away.

12,Choice of next HMM CEO sparks takeover speculation,"1 minute read
HMM
The creditors of HMM, South Koreas flagship carrier, have got tongues wagging in Seoul with the choice of the lines next CEO.
Bae Jae-hoon has decided not to renew his contract with HMM after three years in the job with Kim Kyung-bae designated as his replacement from March 26. Kim was the CEO of another shipping line, Hyundai Glovis, for eight years through to 2017. Hyundai Glovis is owned by Hyundai Motors and the next CEO news has prompted local media to speculate that HMMs creditors have found a buyer for the line finally.
HMM has been controlled by state-run Korea Development Bank (KDB) since it was bailed out in 2016. The bank has said repeatedly it is seeking to find a buyer for HMM.
Officials at both Hyundai Motors and Hyundai Glovis have this week denied any speculation about taking over HMM, a company formerly called Hyundai Merchant Marine.
In related news, another liner boss choosing to stay on rather than leave his post is Rolf Habben Jansen. The supervisory board of Hapag-Lloyd has agreed to an early extension of his contract until March 31 2027. Habben Jansen has been in charge at the Hamburg-based line since 2014.

13,"Theres no COVID-19 vaccine for pets, dogs, cats","3:25 PM EDT May 25, 2021
Updated:
3:25 PM EDT May 25, 2021
Cats, dogs and a few other mammals can become
infected
with COVID-19, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). The public health agency says most of the animals who became infected did so after coming in close contact with a person with COVID-19.
In a now-deleted Reddit post a user said they recently took their dog to the veterinarian and noticed a charge for the Corona Vaccine on their bill. That led the dog owner to ask if pets are being used to pump the coronavirus vaccine numbers.
THE QUESTION
Is there a COVID-19 vaccine for pets?
THE SOURCES
Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)
U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA)
Bill Price, Vice President of Corporate Communications at Zoetis
Dr. Karen Pearson, Veterinarian
THE ANSWER
No, there is no COVID-19 vaccine for pets, but there are pet-specific coronavirus vaccines unrelated to COVID-19.
WHAT WE FOUND
On its website, the CDCbreaks down what coronaviruses are and who or what they can affect:
Coronaviruses are a large family of viruses. Some coronaviruses cause cold-like illnesses in people, while others cause illness in certain types of animals, such as cattle, camels, and bats. Some coronaviruses, such as canine and feline coronaviruses, infect only animals and do not infect people.
Dr. Karen Pearson, a veterinarian based in the Washington, D.C. metropolitan area, told VERIFY the coronavirus vaccines and the viruses themselves are very different. People cannot contract the coronaviruses that dogs and cats get.
Pearson says there is a respiratory infection and an enteric, or intestinal, infection associated with canine coronavirus
The coronavirus vaccine used to be a routinely given vaccine, but we have not seen this respiratory disease in dogs very often so many practices have stopped giving it, she said. It was traditionally part of a core combination vaccine called distemper. It is somewhat of a misnomer because distemper is only one of the viruses the vaccine prevents.
According to the CDC, there is no evidence that animals play a significant role in spreading SARS-CoV-2, or COVID-19, to people at this time.
Based on the available information to date, the risk of animals spreading COVID-19 to people is considered to be low. More studies are needed to understand if and how different animals could be affected by SARS-CoV-2, the CDC says.
The risk is so low that the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) is not consideringapplications for COVID-19 vaccines for cats and dogs at this time, Bill Price, the vice president of Corporate Communications at Zoetistold VERIFY.
Zoetis is one of the largest producers of medicine and vaccinations for pets and livestock in the world. Price says the company stands ready if a need is determined based on its initial research, however, nothing has changed in terms of its development of a COVID-19 vaccine for pets.
If government agencies, including the U.S. Department of Agriculture, determine there is a need for such a vaccine in animals, we are prepared to act quickly and further develop a SARS-CoV-2 vaccine for cats and dogs, and other species as needed, said Price.
The CDC provides a list of tips on how pet owners can protect their pets if they get sick with COVID-19 or if their pet becomes infected with the disease on its website

14,"Cooke County weighing options for more office space, downtown parking","The Kress building at 201. W. California St. in Gainesville.
Gainesville Daily Register file photo
A space squeeze has the Cooke County Commissioners Court thinking about some long term planning.
The countys courthouse in downtown Gainesville is running out of room. The Texas Historic Landmark, built in 1911 and renovated in 2006, houses more county staff than ever thanks to the demands of serving a growing population and complying with state and federal programs.
To wit, Cooke County Auditor Shelly Atteberry recently added two staffers to handle state and federal grant administration, and her office is running out of room, according to County Judge Steve Starnes. On top of that, file cabinets are parked in hallways to free up office space  the same hallways that are packed with people when the countys courts are in session.
Starnes and the commissioners are hosting public work sessions this month and next to look at options. The county acquired the Kress Building, located across California Street from the courthouse, earlier this year for $900,000 with the intent of moving offices in there. The building would require little renovation, he added.
Parking
The moves could also free up new parking space downtown, too.
The biggest emphasis right this minute is how we go about migrating to that building and the effective utilization of the properties that will be abandoned, Starnes told the Register. We've been talking to the city about turning some of the abandoned properties into parking lots.
For instance, if we moved juvenile probation (presently located at 215 S Commerce St.) into the Kress building, then that would be a half a block that could be turned into parking  as one of the biggest restraints that we have from downtown growing is the lack of parking.
Even more parking could be created by moving the states Department of Public Safety office across California Street into the Kress Building as well, Starnes said.
Gainesville City Manager Barry Sullivan said the extra parking downtown would be very welcome.
We (the city and county) are having discussions on what is the most advantageous way to help our downtown, Sullivan said. You can generally find two-hour parking, but thats not what an employee needs, or a juror  business owners need long term parking.
Planning to make a plan
However, nothing has been decided and the commissioners arent close to making up their minds. Some of the money needed to do the work could possibly come from the $8 million in federal stimulus money Cooke County is set to receive through next year, Starnes said.
The work sessions, held every other Monday at 10 a.m. around the regular commission meeting schedule, are part of the commissioners courts intention to craft a long term plan that identifies building needs, possible future staffing requirements and the like.
We want to put one together that identifies what steps we will be taking and what order, who will be responsible for overseeing it, what will be the timeline, what will be the cost? Where will the money come from? said Starnes. I mean, just like the strategic plan that staff Ron or any big corporate company would put together.
 We want to be a little bit more structured, with a specific plan that we will share with the public  Here's what we're planning to do, folks, for the next two years. These are the things that we hope to be able to move, change and improve. And this is the timeline for when we want to try to do it.

15,"Driving Regional Energy Growth in Central Africa: African Energy Week in Cape Town Emphasizes Market-Driven Policies, Local Content Development, and an Enabling Environment","Celtic's Starfelt ready for SPL opener after quarantine
The CEMAC region - which comprises Cameroon, Chad, the Central African Republic, Equatorial Guinea, Gabon, and the Republic of Congo  is richly endowed with multiple natural resources, in which a recent oil and gas boom has the potential to accelerate economic growth and alleviate energy poverty throughout the region. Despite comprising one of the richest areas on the continent  with existing production levels at 700,000 barrels of oil per day and 5 million tons of LNG per annum  the CEMAC region also remains one of the most challenging business environments in Africa, with red tape and burdensome regulations creating significant barriers to entry.
Gas from the YoYo/Yolanda field (which straddles the maritime border between Equatorial Guinea and Cameroon, operated by Noble Energy on both sides) may also be eventually processed at Punta Europa. In mid-2017, Noble Energy signed an agreement with both governments to develop the fields jointly. Resources for YoYo are estimated at 47 Bcfg and 18 MMbc, whilst resources for Yolanda have been estimated at 27 Bcfg. The delays in approving these deals are not helpful to the citizens of both countries and we urge all players to fast track the process. Whilst the Etinde fields are just 35km away from Punta Europa, we are concerned about the delays in developing this project as well. We hope to see an FID soon and free from regional politics.
The region has been blessed by many companies that exploring for energy like Parenco, New Age, Bowleven, Exxon Mobil, lukoil ,Tower Resources, Chevron, Vaalco, Marathon, Atlas Petroleum, Glencore, Total Energies, BW Offshore, Assala Energy, Royal Gate Energy ENI, Kosmos Energy, Panoro Energy etc. They are creating so many beautiful jobs and must be encouraged. The issues of energy transition are real and we welcome an honest dialogue that starts with making energy poverty history.
While the concerted effort amongst all of the worlds nations is fundamental to curb the effects of climate change, it is paramount to have a clear understanding of what efforts will be most decisive, and which regions of the world are in a better position and have the biggest responsibility to tackle these issues. Demonizing energy companies is not a constructive way forward, and ignoring the structural role that carbon-based fuels have in todays society distorts the public debate. Bringing energy companies, governments and civil society groups together to find functional solutions will achieve much more. We in Africa must not be dragged into the western hatred of oil companies. You cant love jobs and hate those who create jobs. We must support our energy companies to ensure jobs and development for our people.
As Dr Martin Luther King Jr., stated in his letter from Birmingham Jail We are caught in an inescapable network of mutuality, tied in a single garment of destiny. Whatever affects one directly, affects all indirectly. We are tied together with these energy companies, and we must never apologize for supporting them and the so many African workers that work in the energy sectors. Africans are the biggest beneficiaries of their investment and their work.
One of the primary challenges hindering investment in the CEMAC region concerns excessive regulations such as the Bank of Central African States (BEAC) newly established foreign exchange (forex) policies. By increasing operational costs and reducing the ease of doing business across the region, such regulations reduce the appeal for foreign investors, rendering the region uncompetitive. With the focus on an effective COVID-19 recovery and accelerated energy sector growth requiring significant amounts of foreign capital, disrupting regulations such as the BEACs could significantly hamper any progress made by the region in recent years.
We at the AEC, continue to believe that the BEACs new forex regulations pose a significant threat to domestic economic growth, directly restricting local business participation and disrupting local content development. The work Mr Jude Kearney and Leoncio Amada Nze are doing leading our AEC taskforce is critical Stated NJ Ayuk, Executive Chairman of the African Energy Chamber
Through adjusted foreign exchange rules, increased tax policies, and restricted capital flow, local businesses will be unable to compete or establish partnerships with international companies, resulting in job losses and associated energy poverty. If the idea of BEAC is to hurt investors, they are not only doing that, but they are also hurting the local companies as well and the bureaucrats of BEAC should not be picking winners and losers. This is against the pro-growth and market driven policies that will ensure economic growth than begging for foreign aid, and we will make it a topic at African Energy Week in Cape Town. Concluded Ayuk
In response to these challenges, the AEC is focused on a multi-stakeholder approach in eliminating red tape, burdensome regulations, and barriers to investment across Africa. Through meetings with BEAC representatives, Leoncio Amada NZE is advocating for an enabling environment, market-driven policies, and increased local participation in the regions energy sector, promoting AEW 2021 in Cape Town as the best platform to drive this trend. By uniting global and African energy stakeholders and financiers in one comprehensive event program, AEW 2021 will be the best place to discuss how the CEMAC region can create a more inclusive energy sector, attract further investment, and facilitate critical intra-African trade.
In driving this narrative, Leoncio Amada NZE has conducted productive meetings with industry leaders in Equatorial Guinea, initiating a valuable dialogue on the role of an enabling environment. Notably, meetings with H.E. Bindang Ndong Okiri, Secretary of State of Planning of the Ministry of Economy and Finance, emphasized how the adoption of fiscal policies that attract Foreign Direct Investment can create a competitive energy sector. Additionally, a meeting with representatives from Marathon Oil  an exploration and production company that has been at the core of Equatorial Guineas economic transformation  generated an insightful discussion on sustainable oil and gas operations. By emphasizing the need for regulatory reform, in which ease of doing business and investor-friendly policies are a focus, both Leoncio Amada NZE and the AEC are focused on driving investment in Africa.
Whats more, in a bid to promote AEW 2021 and invite international participation at Africas premier energy event, Leoncio Amada NZE met with Jesus Alfonso Osa and representatives from ExxonMobils Malabo team to discuss how the oil and gas industry can drive an economic transformation in the CEMAC region. With a firm presence and active participation in Equatorial Guinea for almost three decades, ExxonMobil has been a major contributor to energy sector and GDP growth.

17,High-salt diet found to hamper the immune system,"miskolin/Depositpotos
We know too much salt consumption can mean bad things for our health, driving up blood pressure and with it our chances of heart disease and stroke. Scientists at Germanys University Hospital Bonn have now turned their attention to its impacts on the immune system, finding that a diet too heavy on sodium chloride can also significantly weaken our natural defenses against bacterial infections.
While its drawbacks are well established, previous research has suggested that a high-salt diet may actually benefit human health in some ways. Studies have shown that certain skin infections heal faster in animals fed a high amount of salt and that immune cells called macrophages are more active in the presence of salt, leading some to conclude that a diet high in sodium chloride can boost ones immune system. The new study from the University Hospital Bonn team reveals that's not necessarily the case.
""Our results show that this generalization is not accurate,"" says Katarzyna Jobin, lead author of the study.
According to the team, this is because of the way salt is distributed around the body after it is consumed, and the mechanisms that control it. The skin acts as a kind of salt reservoir, absorbing excess amounts of sodium chloride and keeping salt concentration in the blood and organs more or less constant, which is why some skin diseases benefit from a higher intake of sodium chloride.
Meanwhile, the kidneys play the important role of filtering out excess salt via urine, through what the researchers describe as a sodium chloride sensor. While this does a good job of cleansing the body of additional salt, as a side effect it also leads to the buildup of what are known as glucocorticoids in the body. These hamper the activity of an important type of immune cell in the blood called granulocytes, which are key to fighting bacteria.
The scientists explored what this meant for mice fed a high-salt diet, finding that urinary tract infections healed far more slowly in those subjects. In another experiment they explored the mices impeded ability to fight off listeria infections, which can come about through contaminated food and lead to fever and vomiting.
""We were able to show this in mice with a listeria infection,"" explains Dr. Jobin. ""We had previously put some of them on a high-salt diet. In the spleen and liver of these animals we counted 100 to 1,000 times the number of disease-causing pathogens.""
Another experiment involved human subjects, with the volunteers fed a high-salt diet an extra six grams on top of their daily intake and then providing blood samples for study. The researchers found that the extra salt raised glucocorticoid levels, and that the granulocytes ability to fight off bacteria was far worse as a result.
""We have now been able to prove for the first time that excessive salt intake also significantly weakens an important arm of the immune system,"" explains Prof. Dr. Christian Kurts from the Institute of Experimental Immunology at the University of Bonn.

18,Franny Tacy CEO of Frannys Farmacy,"Frannys Farmacy
today on Hempire only on Cannabis Radio. Franny was raised with farming in her blood. She grew up in Nashville, TN to a cattle farming father and a banking executive mother. Jeff lived on a homestead farm in rural NY with a garden, pigs, chickens, geese, and a family horse. These early histories planted agricultural roots that would later grow over time. Franny experienced her youthful, independent years out west in the Forestry program at Northern Arizona University in Flagstaff. While in college, Franny and friends moved to a farm and developed it with gardens and animals, hosting a monthly Full Moon Festival and getting involved in agricultural crop research. She continued her educational path, completing a Graduate Degree in Education at TN State University.
After four years of teaching, Franny moved to Asheville, NC, and had a successful career in pharmaceutical sales managing a 10 million dollar territory for over 12 years. Frannys frustration with what she calls the unhealthcare system inspired her to return to the land. It was a three-year process on her path of Pharma to Farm before Franny quit her corporate career to focus on building a new business. In 2012, Franny took a leap of faith and bought uncultivated land in Leicester, North Carolina, creating Frannys Farm. Frannys agricultural background and professional career in sales and marketing prepared her for the magic that was soon to happen. In 2017, Franny planted hemp varieties for food and fiber, and without knowing, became the first female hemp farmer in North Carolina in over 75 years. In 2018, Franny pivoted to hemp varieties grown for cannabinoid production, and together, Franny opened her first Frannys Farmacy Dispensary in downtown Asheville NC.

19,"Wi-Fi Radiation Shields, or Router Guards, Are Useless","Mar 25, 2021, 6:40 am EDT
| 5 min read
Skorzewiak/Shutterstock.com
The sun produces solar radiation, and we call that sunlight. Likewise, Wi-Fi uses radio waves, which are a form of radiation. Despite what some snake oil salesmen may tell you, you dont need an EMF shield, router guard, or Wi-Fi radiation shield.
Even if you did want to remove Wi-Fi from your home (and you dont need to!), youd be better off switching to a wired router and ditching all your Wi-Fi hardware. Skip the router cages and router covers.
Blocking Wi-Fi Radiation Means Blocking Wi-Fi
EMF shields or wireless router guards promise to block Wi-Fi radiation. Theres just one problem: Wi-Fi radiation just means Wi-Fi radio waves.
Thats not new, of course: AM and FM radio also use radio waves, for example. So do walkie-talkies, cordless telephones, wireless baby monitors, and many other common technologies that weve lived with for decades.
Since Wi-Fi is just radio waves (a type of radiation), blocking Wi-Fi radiation just means blocking Wi-Fi. If a router guard promises to block 85% of Wi-Fi radiation, thats just another way of saying that it will make your wireless router operate at 15% efficiency.
Wi-Fi Isnt Dangerous
Wi-Fi radiation isnt dangerous to you. We encourage you to read our full explanation of why Wi-Fi radiation isnt dangerous In short, the dangerous type of radiation is ionizing radiationlike X-rays. Ionizing radiation has enough energy to ionize atoms and other molecules by knocking an electron out of their orbit.
However, Wi-Fi counts as non-ionizing radiationlike AM and FM radio. There is no scientific evidence that Wi-Fi radiation is dangerous, just as theres no evidence that the radio waves used by walkie-talkies (in other words, the radiation produced by walkie-talkies) are dangerous.
RELATED:
What Does an EMF Shield or Router Guard Do?
Here it is: A cage for your router. Thatll be $85.
Smart Meter Covers
These devices are a type of Faraday cagethat you place around your router. A Faraday cage is an enclosure that blocks electromagnetic fields. Thats why its called an EMF shieldit functions as a shield against electromagnetic fields (EMFs).
This is a fancy way of saying that a router guard that you place around your router just interferes with the Wi-Fi signal, either weakening it dramatically or blocking it entirely.
Why would someone want to do this? Well, if they believed that Wi-Fi was dangerous, such a device might be valuable! But knowing that Wi-Fi isnt dangerous, we see that there is little point to such a device.
Such devices are unfortunately being widely advertised online, including on Amazon While we definitely believe in the right of everyone to buy these kinds of products if they want themthats freedom, after allwe think you should know that these products are a waste of your money. Even if you believe the premise that Wi-Fi is dangerous, these Wi-Fi shields dont make much sense.
Again, Wi-Fi Is Just Radio Waves, Which Are Radiation
Wi-Fi is just radio waves, and radio waves are a type of radiation. A Wi-Fi router uses electromagnetic frequencies, also known as radio waves or Wi-Fi radiation, to communicate with your devices and give them access to the internet. Thats all it does.
Operating a Wi-Fi router and placing it in a Faraday cage is like setting up a radio broadcast tower and enclosing it in a cage that prevents people from receiving its signal. It doesnt make any sense.
If the Router Guard Works, It Makes Your Wi-Fi Worse
If you look at the reviews for such devices on Amazon, youll see many people leaving one-star reviews complaining that the Wi-Fi shield made their WI-Fi worse. Perhaps it now only works in the same room as the Wi-Fi router, when without the Faraday cage, the Wi-Fi offers a strong signal in every room in their home.
Thats by design. Thats how it works! It works by inhibiting your Wi-Fi signal. Less Wi-Fi radiation escapes the cage, which means that your Wi-Fi is weaker.
But Some Router Guards Promise Strong Wi-Fi!
If you click around and look at these products, youll find that some router guards promise not to interfere with your Wi-Fi. They promise to reduce Wi-Fi radiation while giving you a strong signal. Some products might even have reviews saying, This product works, unlike other router guards that made my Wi-Fi worse!
How can this be?
Well, perhaps the manufacturer is lying and the router guard will actually make your Wi-Fi worse once you set it up.
However, if a particular router guard doesnt interfere with your Wi-Fi signal at all, that means that it isnt doing anything. Its not actually blocking radio waves (radiation) if it doesnt have any effect on your signal.
Perhaps one Wi-Fi EMF shield interferes less with Wi-Fi than another one. That just means that the radiation shield that gives you a better Wi-Fi signal is blocking less Wi-Fi radiation than the one giving you a weaker signal, which is blocking more Wi-Fi radiation.
Theres no free lunch. Wi-Fi is radio waves, which are radiation. Blocking Wi-Fi radiation means blocking your Wi-Fi signal. If you could block 100% of Wi-Fi radiation, youd make your Wi-Fi router 100% useless.
Try Wired Internet If You Dont Want Wi-Fi
Even if Wi-Fi radiation were a concernand were not saying it isa Wi-Fi EMF shield or router guard wouldnt make any sense as a product.
There are several options. Either you have an ineffective shield that gives you good Wi-Fi because it isnt actually blocking anything, an effective EMF shield that is so good that it prevents you from using Wi-Fi, or a shield thats somewhere in the middle, giving you a weak WI-Fi signal but still allowing some of that Wi-Fi radiation (in other words, the Wi-Fi signal) to escape the cage.
If you were concerned about this, you could ditch the Wi-Fi router and get a wired router where you connect your computers and other devices with Ethernet cables instead. You could then avoid using Wi-Fi and prevent your router from emitting any Wi-Fi radiation (in other words, Wi-Fi signal).
But you dont need to do any of this, because Wi-Fi isnt dangerous.
Or Try the National Radio Quiet Zone
The Robert C. Byrd Green Bank Telescope listens for radio signals from deep space in Green Bank, West Virginia.
John M. Chase/Shutterstock.com
Even if you didnt use your own Wi-Fi router, you would still be exposed to other forms of radio waves (radiation). For example, this includes Wi-Fi signals from your neighbors, cell phone signals, Bluetooth device communications, FM radio, AM radio, walkie-talkie signals, cordless phones, wireless baby monitors, and so on.
In the U.S., a good way to avoid a lot of this would be to move to the U.S. National Radio Quiet Zone a place in the country where most types of EMF radiation (including Wi-Fi and cell phone signals) are restricted to reduce disturbancesto sensitive equipment used for scientific research and military intelligence gathering in the area.

After word spread that a Ventura jewelry store owner had been arrested on suspicion of switching customers' diamonds with fakes, many of his former clients discovered they also had been victimized.
'People have been coming in saying, 'Hey, are my stones real?' ' said Debbie Fox, who owns Fox Fine Jewelry in Ventura with her husband, George, a certified gemologist.
The same happened at other jewelry stores, including Nerces Fine Jewelry and Lynn's Jewelry Studio, after Ara Ghazarian, owner of Jewelry Unlimited, was arrested last month on suspicion of grand theft.
There have been so many inquiries that some jewelers are offering free gem identification.
Several Ventura jewelry store owners offered advice to diamond owners seeking out a reputable jeweler.
Bob Lynn, a certified gemologist and owner of Lynn's Jewelry Studio in Ventura, had to tell a woman who came in last Monday that the just-under 3-carat stone she thought was a diamond was actually Moissanite, a rare, naturally occurring crystal that also can be created in a laboratory.
Moissanites vs. Diamonds
North Carolina-based Charles & Colvard is the leading manufacturer of Moissanite stones. The companys website says in the late 1800s French chemist Henri Moissan discovered particles of natural silicon carbide at the site of a meteor strike in Arizona and thought they were diamonds. Moissan spent years trying to recreate the substance in a laboratory. Long after his death researchers perfected the process and patented it for Charles & Colvard.
Ventura jewelers say the main difference between the two stones deals with clarity, color and brilliance.
Moissanites sparkle more than a diamond and give off more of a rainbow effect.
Moissanites are a man-made stones so theres no clarity imperfection or cloudiness.
Moissanites give off a light yellow color.
Her husband had given her the ring to celebrate their 25th anniversary, Lynn said.
'She believed it was a diamond for a number of years,' Lynn said. 'It just broke my heart.'
Of the people who came in to have their diamonds checked, nearly 40 percent had the less-valuable stone, Lynn said.
In the past few weeks at Nerces Fine Jewelry, a newly engaged couple brought in a diamond ring that turned out to be a fake, said owner Nerces Eykjian, a fourth-generation jeweler.
'We got really busy right after' Ghazarian's arrest, Eykjian said. 'We had at least 20 customers, and four or five of them had Moissanites.'
Fox and Eykjian recommend that diamond owners do research before going to a jeweler.
'It's really beneficial that the owner is a jeweler, not a merchant,' Fox said.
Some jewelers are members of the American Gem Society. The requirements are stringent, and members must reapply every year. The organization's website has a list of jewelry stores that are members. Fox Fine Jewelry and Lynn's Jewelry Studio are on that list. However, Lynn said many jewelry stores not on the list are reputable.
It's important to do research on a jeweler, especially when it comes to repairs when the jewelry will remain with the jeweler for an extended period, Fox said. Alterations such as a new setting also take time.
As a safeguard for the business and the client, some jewelers will photograph a diamond before jewelry is repaired and temporarily insure it while it's at the business, Fox said.
A business with a certified gemologist on hand is a sign of a reputable jeweler, Eykjian said.
He said it's important to note that a diamond looks different when it is in a setting and when it is dirty. And most of the time, jewelry is dirty when it arrives for repairs, Fox said.
Hannah Stadler, 25, of Ventura, was one of at least a dozen people who went to Fox's store to check her stones after Ghazarian's arrest. Ventura police allege Ghazarian, who committed suicide last month, was switching out customers' diamonds for Moissanite.
Like many others, Stadler was disappointed to learn the truth about her jewelry.
In April of last year, she took a pair of diamond earrings that were a gift from a former boyfriend to Ghazarian's store for an upgrade because he was the jeweler her mother had gone to for as long as she could remember.
'I thought he was trustworthy,' Stadler said. 'He'd always say, 'Oh, Hannah, you're like a daughter to me.' '
Stadler said Ghazarian told her the diamonds in her earrings were 'junk.' Ghazarian offered to sell her half-carat diamonds for the earrings, but that was going to cost her $1,000. As a college student, it was money Stadler didn't have.
As a favor, Stadler said, Ghazarian let her have the stones and pay them off in $200 monthly installments. Stadler said Ghazarian preferred she pay in cash, and she never got a receipt. So it was a real problem later when she didn't have paperwork to authenticate her stones or the $1,000 she paid him.
'I was very mad because not only did I give him diamonds I already had, but I was out $1,000,' Stadler said.
An essential item in case of theft is paperwork verifying the identity of a stone, jewelers say. Options include an appraisal, a 3-D map of the stone and a diamond grading report, also known as a certificate, Eykjian said.
Lynn highly suggests getting a 3-D map of the stone because there is a lot of 'opinion' in a certificate. A certificate lists a diamond's dimensions, carat, color, clarity and cut. But he says color can be subjective, based on the differences in people's eyesight, and dimensions can differ with the measurement tool used.
Lynn said a proper appraisal, which can include a 3-D map of the stone, should be done.
'It's even more sure than a fingerprint,' Lynn said of the mapping technology. 'It really and truly is the identity of that stone.'
When getting a certificate, the industry standard is a hand-drawn map, Lynn said.
However, a benefit of the report is that the report number is engraved with a laser on the diamond, he",Seven Stones,other,,,,

That comes after the company's in-line fourth-quarter earnings where revenues grew not quite 5% year-over-year.
While BofA says the long-term positive thesis is intact, the stock faces four potential headwinds for a few quarters: It's pushed out launch dates for Service Provider implementations, bringing revenue delays of about six months; Service Provider sales cycles are getting longer, with time from contract to commercial launch stretching between 12-24 months; Service Provider go-to-market strategy is still ""timid,"" with either small launches or heavy promotions (up to three months of free service offered); and plans to invest in Contact Center as a Service will negatively hit cash flow in the short term.

Some Little Irritations of Life are frankly a misnomer. Some Little Irritations of Life are actually Great Big Irritations of Life and, when it comes to ranking irritations, they dont come much bigger than trying to find the end of the Sellotape roll.
For some this is a uniquely festive irritation; for me, it is a fulltime sport. I am a habitual user of Sellotape, and so the irritation is a constant one. And the irritation is made worse because I have a system.
I am an Endover. Whenever I finish using the Sellotape, I fold over a small section (approx. 5mm) so that the end will be easy to find the next time I come to use it. Except
Except, whenever I next come to use the Sellotape, my neat solution has been foiled; sabotaged; usurped, leaving me uselessly scrabbling with blunt fingernails along an apparently seamless surface, attempting to identify the vital join.
The problem. I am a solitary Endover in a household of Free Radicals.
Charlotte Reed suggests that trying to find the end of the Sellotape is a wonderful opportunity to deepen your inner calm
. She is wrong. It is an opportunity to rail against all the injustices of the world: poverty; famine; a Trump administration in the White House; London Northwesterns new timetables.

28,$250K grant helps Spartanburg's ReGenesis Health Care add mobile medical center,"OneSpartanburg begins planning next 5-year development strategy, seeks input from public
Asia Rollinsarollins@postandcourier.com
When you take a look at their curriculum and the type of medical care that they're going to be providing in communities here in Spartanburg and across the U.S., their model, the osteopathic model, is in line with how federally qualified health centers like ReGenesis provide care, Hunter said.
ReGenesis provides a range of primary care services that include medical, dental, behavioral health, pediatric, school-based services and chiropractic care.
Patients receive non-generic medications at a deeply discounted price available to federally-qualified health centers called the 340B Drug Pricing Program. For those without insurance, the company has a sliding fee scale that allows patients to pay a nominal fee to receive comprehensive care. ReGenesis also has pharmacies on-site in Gaffney and at the Church Street location in Spartanburg, and a freestanding retail pharmacy in Duncan.
Hunter said ReGenesis hopes to remove price as a barrier to care.
Many folks dont go because theyre worried about how much this is going to cost me, Hunter said. The lowest nominal fee is $20, and if you dont have the full $20, we will work with you and put you on a payment plan for as low as $5 to get you in the door.",Regenesis Biomedical,new initiatives or programs,company description,,,

31,Eurostar relaunches direct Disneyland Paris route with fares from 39 each way,"comments
Heading to Disneyland Paris just got that little bit easier for Brits as Eurostar is bringing back its direct route between London and Mickey Mouse's French home.
The high speed rail service had to temporarily suspend the route due to the impact of the coronavirus pandemic, but has now announced that operations will resume on Friday (March 25).
There are some tempting deals to be found too, with fares from 39 each way for adults, and 28 each way for children (children under four can travel for free).
The company will continue to offer extra perks such as a baggage allowance with no weight restrictions - and as there's no need to wait at baggage reclaim on the other side, it gives you even more time to enjoy the Disney parks!
Sign up to the Mirror's travel newsletter for more deals and holiday tips sent direct to your inbox.

The total journey time takes approximately 2 hours and 49 minutes, with direct trains initially running for four days a week during term time, and then rising to five days a week in the summer holidays. Bookings have now opened until January 23.
You can find out more and book on Eurostar.com.
There's plenty of Disney magic awaiting families who do book in to Disneyland Paris.
For a start, character hugs and close up photos are back as France has been easing up its local Covid rules.
The resort is actually celebrating its 30th anniversary in style complete with a new daytime show, new costumes for Mickey and his friends, and even brand new attraction Gardens of Wonder.

Visiting France in general has become easier too. Fully vaccinated Brits can visit France for non-essential reasons such as holidays, and all travellers need to sign a 'sworn statement' before visiting, although they no longer require a pre-travel Covid test.
Meanwhile, local Covid restrictions including face masks and vaccine passes have been lifted, meaning you'll no longer require these for the likes of indoor venues including bars, hotels and museums.

33,COVID-19: Helping Children With Autism Spectrum Disorder Cope,"For a .pdf of this article, click here
Additional tips for families of children with autism can be found here
The typical school day as we knew it has changed for all children during the coronavirus pandemic. For children with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD), this sudden change in routine has been especially challenging and disruptive. Heres some advice on how parents can help children with ASD adjust to the changes in their predictable daily schedule.
What are some of the key challenges right now for children with ASD?
One of the most important things for children with ASD is that they have a routine. Most are used to going to school and it can be difficult for some children to cope when their routine has been disrupted. Having a schedule is very important to their sense of calm and normalcy. With kids now having to stay home for an extended period of time, the stressors of having their routine disrupted is likely to cause them anxiety and stress, which may be evident in their behavior and acting out. I suggest working with your childs teacher to maintain a schedule at home that is as similar to your childs school schedule to the best of your ability.
I recommend limiting access to media, and I say that to all families with kids even those who are not on the spectrum. Most children sense how the adults around them are feeling and will pick up on angst, anxiety and panic. It is best for parents to remain calm and try to answer questions as honestly as they can, and communicate with their child in a way that is familiar to them. Most families with an autistic child are communicating through pictures. There are some resources online, such as this free social narrative which help provide visuals about what is happening right now.
It's also more important than ever to explain to children with ASD to communicate if they arent feeling well. For many, their brain doesnt register discomfort, pain or tiredness in the same way as other children. Parents need to monitor their children carefully because they may not be communicating that their throat hurts or that they feel hot or cant breathe. During the COVID-19 pandemic, monitoring becomes very important. Most children will benefit if parents continue to use whatever communication device is utilized at school during this time at home. If, for example your child uses the Picture Exchange Communication System (PECS) or communication device, incorporate the use of that device at home. Anything parents can do to make their day similar to what it was will help.
How can parents help their child during this difficult time?
Your child is unique, and because you know them best, think about how much information you want to provide them, and the extent of detail that will help them without overwhelming them. With COVID-19, depending on their ability to understand, some kids may find comfort in knowing details, where others may become more anxious and benefit from having less access to information or modified details.
As parents, you are the number one advocate for your child. Its important to stay in touch with your childs teachers, support staff, and therapists. Many children with special needs rely on their support team every day to keep them centered. They may not understand why they are not seeing them regularly, and fear that they are gone. This is when virtual connections through apps such as FaceTime or Zoom can be really beneficial. Such connections may enable kids to see their teacher and/or therapist and maintain those important relationships during this stressful time. You may want to consider setting time aside for your child to virtually connect with classmates and friends that they are accustomed to seeing every day through this same venue.
What are some activities that can help keep children with ASD occupied?
My first question would be, What would the child be doing at that time if they were still enrolled in school? Keep in mind that maintaining a reliable routine may be beneficial, and try to incorporate similar school activities wherever possible. The reality is that most children with sensory issues cannot be left for even short periods of time without supervision, which adds great challenges to working parents during this crisis. Many children that are considered to be on the autism spectrum are able to access and utilize online learning games, and although we not want children to become overly dependent on any type of screened device, it may help for a short time. Also encourage gross motor activities. Consider yoga or online activities for kids. This encourages movement and flexibility, and is important not only for their mental health but also their physical health.
How do you keep a sensory craver busy at home?
Often it helps to alternate stimulation. Rather than having all of your childs favorite sensory items/toys within reach, it often helps to rotate them in and out of reach so that each becomes more novel and fresh. Keep in mind that you never want to remove a favorite item that the child is very attached to. Children will often have a renewed sense of excitement over an older toy/item that they have not seen in a while and rediscover new ways of playing with it.

35,Maine attorney general sues pharmaceutical company over opioid crisis,"Read Article
Maine Attorney General Aaron Frey on Monday filed a lawsuit against Purdue Pharma and members of the drug manufacturers Sackler family, arguing that they committed unfair and deceptive business practices while marketing opioids in Maine.
Freys move adds Maine to a lengthening list of states and municipalities that are turning to the courts in an effort to hold the company accountable for the devastating social and economic impacts of opioid use disorder.
Related Headlines
Lost: Heroins killer grip on Maines people
The complaint in Kennebec County Superior Court details Connecticut-based Purdue Pharmas successful efforts to deceptively market opioid drugs in Maine from 2007 through 2017, as Maines opioid crisis reached epidemic levels, according to a news release from the attorney general. The marketing practices violated Maine law, according to the complaint.
Maines drug overdose deaths reached an all-time high in 2017 at 417 deaths before declining to 354 deaths in 2018.
Purdue and the Sackler defendants misled Maine consumers, and in doing so played a significant role in accelerating the opioid epidemic, said Frey in a statement. Our complaint alleges that their unrelenting sales visits to doctors and deceptive practices led to a marked increase in opioid prescriptions, and a corresponding increase in the number of Mainers suffering from opioid use disorder. Maine deserves accountability and redress from Purdue and the Sacklers.
A spokesman for Purdue Pharma denied the accusations and called the Maine lawsuit misleading and sensationalized.
According to the Maine attorney generals news release, the Federal Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration estimated that an average of 10,400 Maine residents each year struggled with opioid abuse disorder (including heroin use and pain relievers) between 2007 and 2016. Of the 2,206 opioid overdose deaths in Maine between 2007 and 2018 (numbers which include deaths involving heroin and non-prescription fentanyl), 1,321 were caused by prescription opioids. Of those deaths, 482 were caused by oxycodone.
Marc Malon, a spokesman for the Maine attorney generals office, said Maine, California, Hawaii and the District of Columbia filed lawsuits on the same day as part of a coordinated strategy, although the specifics of the lawsuits are somewhat different because laws in each state are different. Portland, Bangor and other Maine towns have filed lawsuits against Purdue Pharma and other drug manufacturers for the opioid crisis.
Forty states and more than 2,000 local governments have previously filed lawsuits against Purdue Pharma. The legal strategy is similar to when states sued tobacco companies, resulting in a 1998 settlement that paid billions to states for tobacco companies falsely claiming that tobacco was a safe product.
Malon said that the amount of damages the Maine Attorney Generals Office is seeking hasnt yet been publicly disclosed but will be during court hearings.
Robert Josephson, a spokesman for Purdue Pharma, pointed to how a judge in a state court in North Dakota on May 10 dismissed a lawsuit brought by the North Dakota attorney general in that state.
In the 27-page decision, North Dakota District Judge James Hill ruled that Purdue cannot control how doctors prescribe its products and certainly cannot control how individual patients use and respond to its products.
Josephson said that Purdue Pharma vigorously denies the allegations contained in litigation against the company and will continue to defend itself against these misleading attacks. These sensationalized claims are part of a continuing effort to try these cases in the court of public opinion rather than the justice system, as plaintiffs are unable to connect the conduct alleged to the harm described. Instead, they have invented stunningly overbroad legal theories, which if adopted by courts, will undermine the bedrock legal principle of causation.
But Frey argued in court filings that Purdue Pharma has made unsubstantiated claims about how opioids lead to addiction and the extent to which addiction risk can be managed and has been misrepresenting and making unsubstantiated claims that increased doses of opioids did not pose significant additional risks of addiction.
In 2016, Maine lawmakers approved a strict new prescribing law that, in some cases, limits dosages and length of prescriptions for chronic pain.
Maine Senate President Troy Jackson, D-Allagash, praised Frey for filing suit.
Its clear that several pharmaceutical companies, including Purdue Pharma, aggressively pushed opioids onto patients, physicians and the general public. They need to be held accountable for their role in this epidemic and the lengths they stooped to while trying to make obscene profits, Jackson said.",MaineGeneral Health,executive statement,,,,
36,MU Health shifts staff as omicron surge keeps going,"3 days ago
COLUMBIA, Mo. (KMIZ.)
COVID-19 continues to send many people to the hospital and sicken health staff, putting a big strain on doctors and nurses nationwide.
Like many other hospitals, MU Health Care is facing staffing concerns. The providers are now reassigning nurses from non-clinical areas to bedside shifts at its hospitals.
""MU Health Care is experiencing a record-high number of patients hospitalized with active COVID-19, a rise in influenza hospitalizations and staffing pressures related to an ongoing nationwide shortage of health care workers and staff absences related to illness,"" MU Health Care spokesman Eric Maze wrote in an email Thursday.
According to MU Health Care COVID-19 data , as of Thursday, the hospital had 122 COVID-19 inpatients, 30 ICU patients and 19 patients on ventilators.
""And today we're at 122 for covid, so we're about 20 percent higher than we ever have been before um it's hitting us harder than it ever has before because just like every hospital in America were facing staffing shortages,"" MU doctor Laura Hesemann said.
MU Health Care has also delayed half of its scheduled elective procedures because of its high demand for Covid-19 patients.
""This Thursday and Friday we're down about 50 percent. So we have delayed those surgeries to happen later. We know these surgeries need to happen but today is not the right day to do those,"" Hesemann said.
Although the hospital is facing staffing shortages and an uptick in COVID-19 patients they are working hard to adjust staffing and hours as needed.
""We continually assess hospital inpatient and outpatient clinic volumes and adjust staffing and hours of availability as needed to best meet the needs of our community. As an added measure to meet the current pressures, MU Health Care is reactivating its labor pool to proactively identify and deploy nurses working in non-clinical areas to patient-facing areas,"" Maze wrote.
The labor pool is a staffing accommodation that involves employees who aren't necessarily involved in patient care but have maintained their education and credentials. The assigned employees will receive training so they can assist in roles that are needed.
""We have an obligation to make changes as we can to fulfill our primary mission of delivering patient care and caring for our community. We appreciate the flexibility and dedication of our nurses who contribute to our vital mission of caring for patients,"" Maze said.
The surge has pushed Boone County's new case numbers to No. 1 in the state per capita. Cole County is No. 2, and Callaway is No. 3. Deaths, however, have been falling statewide.
MU Health and other hospitals have also delayed elective procedures in recent weeks as omicron case levels are diagnosed at unprecedented levels.
Hospitalizations are up in Central Missouri and across the state
, according to the Missouri Department for Health and Senior Services. There are currently 249 hospitalized patients and 41 in intensive care in the region. The total COVID-19 hospitalizations for the region and the state as a whole are records, surging beyond the highs set last winter, before vaccines were widely available. However, ICU admissions have not reached those same peaks, as experts say illness from omicron is generally milder than the previously dominant delta variant.
The region has 29% of its inpatient beds available.
""I'd really like people to be thinking about staying at home when they're sick. I know that it's tiring and we are all tired of missing out on social events and we're tired of being away from people. But now more than ever it's important for people to not spread the disease,"" Hesemann said.

While Anna Passey is well known for playing Sienna Blake, the actress began her acting career in 2007 with a role in the TV film Last Flight to Kuwait.
Following roles in films including Two Days In The Smoke and TV series including Free Rein, it was not long before her acting talents were noticed by soap bosses - with Anna landing her now famous role as Sienna Blake in Hollyoaks in 2012.
She has since played Sienna for over 10 years, and during that time has been involved in some huge storylines including the birth of Sienna's twins and the character's battle with cancer.

Following the cancer story line, Anna paid tribute to the people who shared their own experiences of the disease with the actress and praised the soap's writers, saying in a tweet: ""Shout out to all the amazing real life women who shared their experiences of cancer in pregnancy with me to help me with this storyline.
""I'm so proud of @Hollyoaks for telling this story.""
Talking about the story to Digital Spy, Anna also added: ""Apparently it happens quite a lot where people don't have smear tests, don't get checked out, then they get pregnant and it's the first time anyone really has a good look around in there. So it's actually quite common for people to find out they have cancer when they're pregnant.
""Hopefully it will create some awareness and show people that it's better to get checked and find out ahead of time, rather than to be left in that awful situation.""

Many of the Hollyoaks cast have had relationships with their co-stars, including Anna Passey, who has dated two of her fellow cast members.
Anna had a long-term relationship with Lockie Campbell actor Nick Rhys, after the couple began dating in 2013.
Their relationship even spanned across the globe, after Nick moved to Los Angeles to take up acting roles in the city.

""It's not always easy with him on the other side of the world but that's often what you get when you date another actor. Maybe I should have chosen a plumber or something only joking!
""I've just been out to California to see him actually and to catch up with other friends who live there. I had a great time.""
However their romance sadly did not last, and the couple parted ways later that year.

The loved up couple are still together, with Anna revealing the sweet surprise gift that Kyle bought her in the same year - a surfboard.
She revealed during an interview with Inside Soap that Kyle loves to surf, but that their trip to surf the waves in Portugal was cancelled during the pandemic.
However, Anna planned to get plenty of practice in before they took off on their first surfing holiday, saying: ""One day, the doorbell rang and there was a surfboard waiting for me, so I realised I had to properly learn how to do it!
""It's quite a commitment however, it's really addictive. It's taken me a while, but I'm finally at a point where I'm competent and know what I'm doing. It's a lot of fun!""

When Anna is not on our TV screens or practicing her surfing skills, she can be found sharing snaps of her stunning home on social media - including the many gatherings she has with friends.
That star has given fans a glimpse into her gorgeous home in a series of Instagram posts, including one adorable snap of her dog sat on a chair at the kitchen table.
Her home has a vintage vibe, complete with a dark wood fireplace, decorated with a rustic clock and surrounded by bouquets of flowers.
The star regularly mixes vintage furniture with a modern aesthetic, creating a classy and eye catching decor, which is regularly admired by fans.
As well as classic art work prints and a record player sat on top of a wooden chest, Anna's home has a party atmosphere - complimented by photographs of the actress entertaining friends and family in one of its many rooms.
She even shared a snap of her friends cooking in her incredible kitchen, showing one of the many ways that Anna likes to relax away from Hollyoaks.

41,Industry Challenges' Blamed For DriveTribe's Demise,"After five years of questionable existence, DriveTribe is shutting down its website at the end of January. Industry challenges, like tightening marketing budgets and the ongoing chip shortage, have been pegged as the reason why the site will go dark. Those issues have made it impossible for the ad-supported site to continue, according to a blog post from the company.
The community will continue in some form on YouTube and other social media platforms. Itll primarily be fronted by Richard Hammond and his team who were already doing the brunt of the work on their social media channels.
Although were all really disappointed that our DriveTribe website business has to come to an end, Im really delighted to be continuing our relationship with this brilliant community. Theres never been a more exciting time to talk about the industry as we deal with these hugely challenging market forces and the rapid evolution of what we mean by motoring, Hammond wrote. Come and join me on the channels along with lots of familiar DriveTribe faces as we continue to keep the brand alive and the conversation going.
DriveTribe was founded in 2016 with the support of the Top Gear trio Jeremy Clarkson, Richard Hammond and James May along with their producer Andy Wilman. Its unveiling coincided with their other new venture: The Grand Tour on Amazon.
CEO Ernesto Schmitt handled site operations while the trio used their notoriety to drum up enthusiasm and traffic for the site.
Were all really disappointed that challenges in the industry not in the least helped by the ongoing pandemic have simply made it impossible to continue with the business in its current form, Clarkson said in the blog post. Im very much looking forward to seeing what mischief Hammond and his team get up to as they take the channels and the community forward.
Users were meant to join Tribes hosted by members of the TG/GT trio or start their own, and it could be centered around anything car related. In 2018, we reported that Drive Tribe had burned through nearly $16 million in just two years, and its unlikely their fortunes ever got better. The part news/part social media site never really became the hub of car culture it was supposed to be, and now it never will.

Civica has been used to being the acquirer over the past few years as it expanded its business, but SCC has also been active on that front, using expansion as an opportunity to plug gaps and add depth to its services proposition.
This deal adds to a growing number that have been struck across the channel in the first few weeks of 2022, with an emphasis being on gaining access to more services to support the ongoing shift to a managed services model.

44,Widescape Claims to Be a Snowmobile Like No Other Lets You Float on Snow Standing Up,"1 Mar 2022, 08:53 UTC 
by
Cristina Mircea
Lightweight, agile, and with a stand-up design, the Widescape WS250 is a snowmobile like no other, at least from the manufacturers point of view. This thing makes you feel like youre riding a 250cc motorcycle through the snow, but instead of getting stuck in, you easily float on it.
7 photos
The vehicle is the creation of Widescape, a Canadian company that goes so far as to call it the first-ever stand-up snowmobile The WS250 is definitely fun to ride, at least for shorter periods, as you might find it a bit discomforting to stand up on it all day long. It was built for off-trail adventures and deep forests, where it is easy to maneuver. Learning how to ride the snowmobile is a 15-minute job, according to the manufacturer.
Widescape boasts of the
snowmobile
being very light and compact, but sturdy enough to cope with both cold and shocks. Riders stand on an anti-slip platform that keeps them in place. The WS250 weighs under 200 lb. (90 kg). That is indeed lighter than regular snowmobiles, which tip the scales at 400-500 lb (180-226 kg). It is 7.2 (2.1 m) long, 2.6 (0.8 m) wide, and 4.3 (1.3 m) high, and it fits in most pickup trucks. You can also carry it on the rear rack of most SUVs.

Shake cakes are agreat way to use up those Optavia or Medifast shakes if you just don't feel like drinking them or if you want a wonderful portable meal to take along with you when you are on the go!

These are dense and spongy cakes rather than light and fluffy ones, but they are pretty yummy!
I used a french vanilla shake, topped it with a serving of Reddi Whip and sprinkled a tiny bit of powdered peanut butter on top. Two tablespoons of powdered peanut butter counts as one optional snack, but I used a 1/2 tsp.

The retreat of big biopharma from neuroscience R&D continued apace in 2019, with Amgen axing its neuroscience unit and Eli Lilly shuttering a U.K. facility. Those actions came in the wake of Pfizers 2018 decision to get out of neuroscience discovery and clinical development along with a much earlier wave of cuts involving companies including GlaxoSmithKline and Novartis.
After a decade of cuts, big companies have a reduced presence in neuroscience R&D. If that process is to go into reverse, big players will likely need to see evidence that the high failure rates and weak returns on investment that drove them out of the field are a thing of the past.
A clutch of smaller companies are working to show neuroscience R&D can be a therapeutically and economically worthwhile activity. Around one-third of the Fierce 15 class of 2019 had some involvement in neuroscience R&D, and a scan of the mental illnessand neurological disorderpipeline reports from PhRMA shows small players account for a significant share of assets in development.

How the assets covered in those reports fare will influence the direction of travel for big biopharma in neuroscience R&D in the coming years. Expensive, high-profile failures could persuade companies that have stuck with the field to decide their R&D budget would be better spent elsewhere. On the flip side, a few successes that suggest researchers are getting to grips with the underlying biology of the brain could renew interest in the big therapeutic and economic opportunities in neuroscience.
The same dynamics may play out in the VC-backed biopharma space that is keeping neuroscience R&D afloat, with successes or failures potentially driving money into or out of the field.

Come January, the amount you pay for an out-of-pocket medical bill likely to be way less
Patients are less than two months away from not having to worry about most surprise medical bills those extra costs that can amount to hundreds or thousands of dollars when people are unknowingly treated by an out-of-network doctor or hospital.
Whats not clear is whether the changes in law made by the No Surprises Act which takes effect Jan. 1 will have the unintended consequences of shifting costs and leading to higher insurance premiums.
Probably not, many policy experts told KHN. Some predict it may slightly slow premium growth.
The reason, said Katie Keith, a research faculty member at the Center on Health Insurance Reforms at Georgetown University, is that a rule released Sept. 30by the Biden administration appears to put a thumb on the scale to discourage settlements at amounts higher than most insurers generally pay for in-network care.
That rule drew immediate opposition from hospital and physician groups, with the American Medical Association calling it an undeserved gift to the insurance industry, while the American College of Radiology said it does not reflect real-world payment rates and warned that relying on it so heavily will cause large imaging cuts and reduce patient access to care.
Such tough talk echoes comments made while Congress was hammering out the law.
The most recent guidance is the third issued to implement the law which passed in late 2020 after a years-long battle. It was signed by then-President Donald Trump.
The No Surprises Act takes aim at a common practice: large, unexpected balance bills being sent to insured patients for services such as emergency treatment at out-of-network hospitals or via air ambulance companies. Some patients get bills even after using in-network facilities because they receive care from a doctor who has not signed on with an insurers network.
Patients were caught in the middle and liable for the difference between what their insurer paid toward the bill and the often-exorbitant charges they received from the provider.
Story continues
Patients would pay only network cost
Once the law takes effect next year, patients will pay only what they would have if their care had been performed in network, leaving any balance to be settled between insurers and the out-of-network medical providers. The law also gives insurers and providers 30 days to sort out discrepancies.
After that, unsettled bills can enter baseball-style arbitration, in which both sides put forth their best offer and an arbitrator picks one, with the loser paying the arbitration cost, which the rule sets for next year as between $200 and $500.
Uninsured patients who are billed more than $400 over an upfront estimate of the cost of their care may also bring cases to arbitration for a $25 administrative fee.
Businesses, like government services companies or those that review coverage disputes, can start applying now for certification as arbitrators. The rule estimates that about 50 will be selected by the three agencies overseeing the program, the Departments of Health and Human Services, Labor and Treasury, after showing expertise in arbitration, health care claims experience, managed care, billing and coding, and health care law. The rule also spells out that either party can object to a chosen arbitrator and the one that is selected cannot be associated with an insurer or medical provider.
But which price to pick in arbitration?
The new rule specifies that the arbitrator generally should pick the amount closest to the median in-network rate negotiated by insurers for that type of care. Other factors, such as the experience of the provider, the type of hospital or the complexity of the treatment, can be considered in some circumstances, but not given equal weight.
By contrast, some of the more than a dozen state laws taking aim at surprise bills allow arbitrators to consider higher rates, such as billed charges set by hospitals or doctors, rather than negotiated rates,
A recent study
, for example, found that in New Jersey which has different arbitration rules than what is being set up for the federal program cases were settled at a median of 5.7 times higher than in-network rates for the same services.
Unlike New Jersey, the federal government is specifically barring consideration of the highest amounts the billed charges and the lowest payment amounts, including those from Medicaid and Medicare programs.
This seems likely to reduce premiums in addition to protecting patients from surprise bills, said Loren Adler, associate director of the University of Southern California-Brookings Schaeffer Initiative for Health Policy, who co-authored the New Jersey study.
Still, the laws impact on premiums is open to debate. Keith doubts they will change either way, although Adler thinks the slowdown in premium growth would be small.
Even the final rule says there is uncertainty around how premiums will be ultimately affected with much depending on how often disputed bills go to arbitration.
The latest rulecited a Congressional Budget Office estimatethat provisions in the No Surprises Act could reduce premium growth by 0.5% to 1% in most years, but also noted an estimate from the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services that premiums could slightly increase. Neither study isolated the effect of the arbitration guidelines from the rest of the statute.
Adler noted that relying heavily on the median in-network price likely means lower payments as compared with other measures but, still, by definition a median is what half of doctors get paid, so this could, in theory, raise that for the other half.
Incentive for doctors to join networks
Whats likely, health policy experts said, is that the new law will prompt more providers to join insurer networks.
Some physicians most often, emergency room doctors, anesthesiologists and radiologists have avoided signing contracts with insurers. Instead, they typically set charges above the level of insurers reimbursement and sent surprise bills to patients for the difference.
The rule undercuts the incentive to use this business model.
It makes it pretty clear that hospitals, physicians, air ambulances and other medical professionals should not count on staying out of network and then trying to use the federal process to capture higher reimbursement, said Keith.
Some medical societies and advocacy groups predicted the law could have the opposite effect.
Insurers will use the disputes to drive down payment to the point that it is no longer feasible for many providers to take that, or any insurance, warned Katie Keysor, senior director of economic policy for the American College of Radiology, in an emailed statement.

52,Oil & Gas Stock Roundup Headlined by Whiting-Oasis Merger,"Free Report
) also made it to the headlines.
Overall, it was a bearish seven-day period for the sector. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude futures lost 5.5% to close at $109.33 per barrel, while natural gas prices fell 5.8% to end at $4.725 per million British thermal units (MMBtu).
It was a wild week for oil. After surging to a 14-year high of over $130 a barrel amid fears of Russian production squeeze, the commodity pulled back sharply on speculation that production from alternate sources will make up for the potential loss of output from Moscow. It should be noted that the negative price action overshadowed a report from the Energy Information Administration showing draws in crude and fuel stockpiles
Natural gas tallied a weekly loss too, spooked by a mild weather outlook and the subsequent lull in demand.
Recap of the Weeks Most-Important Stories
1. U.S. upstream operators Whiting Petroleum and Oasis Petroleum jointly announced that both the companies signed agreements to combine in a $6-billion merger of equals transaction.
The companies stated that the merged entity will have the leading Williston Basin position in North Dakota and Montana, with top-tier assets spanning over 972,000 net acres and an output of about 167,800 barrels of oil equivalent per day, an improved free cash flow generation and a substantial scale of operations.
Per the terms of the transaction, Whiting shareholders will be given 0.5774 shares of OAS common stock and $6.25 in cash for each share of WLL stock held. Oasis shareholders will receive a special dividend of $15.00 per share ahead of the close. On the closing of the deal, which is expected to be done by the second half of this year, Whiting and Oasis shareholders will own approximately 53% and 47% in the merged company, respectively. (

2. The energy giant, Shell, recently stated that it is withdrawing from the Russian oil and gas industry in a phased manner and is instantly discontinuing all spot purchases of Russian crude. This development is in line with the U.S. Governments new guidelines of banning the import of oil and other energy sources from Russia, in response to Russias military campaign in Ukraine.
Shell also declared that it would not renew any Russian term contracts and close its service stations, aviation fuels and lubricants operations in the country. The company further said that it would eventually find substitutes for the Russian supply but stressed that it might take some time, leading to lower output at some of its refineries.
Europes largest oil company apologized after it faced criticism over buying the cargo of Russian crude at a reduced price after many other firms started to curb their purchases. SHEL mentioned that it would commit profits from its Russian oil purchases to humanitarian funds meant to alleviate the emergency in Ukraine. (

3 Calgary-based energy infrastructure provider TC Energy declared that it signed option agreements to sell 10% of its interest in the Coastal GasLink natural gas pipeline project to indigenous communities across the pipeline's route. The prospect of having equity ownership is available to the native groups that already hold existing agreements with the 670 km-long development.
This project, in which TC Energy owns a 35% interest, while KKR and Alberta Investment Management together hold a 65% stake, has been opposed by environmentalists and First Nations (a term used to identify the native Canadian population) for several years as they contend that the pipeline trespasses the traditional native land.
Built in British Columbia, Canada's westernmost province, the Coastal GasLink pipeline will have a preliminary transport capacity of 2.1 billion cubic feet per day. The project will transport natural gas from the Montney gas-producing region, the Groundbirch area west of Dawson Creek, to the permitted LNG Canada export facility near Kitimat. (

4. Delek US Holdings stated that it signed a stock purchase and cooperation agreement with Carl Icahn and the Icahn Group for the buyback of $64 million worth, or approximately 50%, of Delek USs common stock owned by the Icahn Group for about $18.3 per share. The $18.30 figure is the closing price of DKs common shares on Mar 4, 2022, the last trading day preceding the agreements execution.
Per the terms of the deal, the Icahn Group will pull out its nomination of directors and agree to a standstill restriction through the completion of Delek USs 2023 annual stockholders meeting and abstain from purchasing additional shares of the refiners common stock.
Delek US mentioned that it would make use of the available cash in hand to fund this share repurchase program. The companies anticipate the share buyback to close ahead of Mar 11, 2022, bound by certain customary closing conditions, after which the Icahn Group is likely to own roughly 3.48 million common shares of Delek US, which represent about 4.93% of the company's outstanding shares.

54,5 reasons you need to see Gorillas in Uganda,"Twitter
Volcanoes National Park is among the parks whose tourism and research activities were suspended by RDB to curb Coronavirus pandemic (PHOTO/File)
Sitting in silence on the cold ground of a Ugandan forest for 60 minutes might be one of lifes greatest privileges. There are fewer than 900 mountain gorillas in existence, and gorilla trekking provides a rare opportunity to observe the everyday interactions of these gentle, mysterious primates.
Mountain gorillas only live in the dense vegetation of Ugandas Bwindi Impenetrable Forest National Park and along with the dormant volcanic Virunga mountain range that stretches across Rwandas Volcanoes National Park, Ugandas Mgahinga Gorilla National Park, and Virunga National Park in the Democratic Republic of the Congo.
In 1981, environmentalists estimated there were only 254 mountain gorillas left in the world, but the small population is rising slowly thanks to intense international conservation efforts. Since these critically endangered creatures cant survive in captivity, the only way to see them is by trekking up to their natural habitat: misty cloud forests that can reach altitudes of 14,763 feet.
Here are 5 reasons to make Uganda your base for this incredible journey.
Youll be where half the worlds Mountain Gorillas live
There are two gorilla trekking spots in Uganda: Bwindi Impenetrable Forest National Park and Mgahinga Gorilla National Park. Gorillas dont pay mind to political borders, so populations across the Virungas are relatively fluid. Uganda has an edge, however, since Bwindi alone is home to half of the worlds mountain gorillas.
Bwindi Impenetrable Forest National Park (also called The Place of Darkness due to its dense treetops) is an ancient, montane, and lowland forest spanning 128 square miles. The region was named a UNESCO World Heritage site thanks to its incredible biodiversity and the large number of endangered species that call it home.
Mgahinga Gorilla National Park accounts for 13 square miles of the larger Virunga habitat, which stretches across 168 square miles into Rwanda and the Democratic Republic of the Congo. The national park includes three of the eight major Virunga peaks: Mount Gahinga, Mount Muhabura, and Mount Sabyinyo.
Habitat destruction is the main threat to mountain gorillas. Communities around the parks are heavily populated, and residents have traditionally used land around national park boundaries for farming or logging.
Since tourism is now Ugandas most lucrative industry, and the majority of tourists come to see the mountain gorillas, trekkers are encouraged to seek out ways to give back to the communities they visit. One popular option is to hire a porter, who is always a local resident and occasionally a reformed poacher. The landscape within the parks is unpredictable and difficult; porters help guide trekkers through river crossings and up steep, muddy inclines.

Other options is to participate in community-led cultural initiatives. In Bwindi village, the Bwindi Bar trains disenfranchised young adults in hospitality through rigorous classes and work experience. Around Mgahinga, elders of the Batwa tribe lead visitors on a forest tour along the Batwa Trail, explaining how their self-sufficient, forest-dwelling tribe traditionally used medicinal plants.
There are strict regulations in place to make sure the gorillas stay healthy and wildstarting with the gorilla trekking permit process. Daily viewings of each gorilla group are extremely limited, so visitors should apply well before their desired dates.
In Uganda, permit costs vary depending on the season. In April, May and November, permits are $450. The rest of the year, they cost $600. In contrast, permits in Rwanda now cost $1,500 year-round.
Most trekking in Uganda takes place in Bwindi, where there are multiple starting points and several gorilla families to track. Visits are led by park rangers and groups of eight are allowed to observe the gorillas for one hour, in silence and at a safe distance.
You can take on challenging Terrain.
One look at southwestern Ugandas green terraced hills and rolling volcanic slopes and its clear this area of the country is not for the faint of heart. Add in the high altitude and the challenging terrain, and gorilla trekking in Uganda promises to be the adventure of a lifetime.
A Gorilla Trek is a highlight of all visits done in Uganda and Rwanda and certainly mountain gorillas are the major reason as to why very many people visit these 2 destinations (PHOTO/File)
Its hard work to reach the gorillas. It requires navigating uphill and downhill through thick tangles of vines, thorns, and roots. The appropriately named Bwindi Impenetrable Forest National Park is only accessible by foot. There are no paths, no signs, no directionsand more often than not, no clearings (which is why the park rangers carry machetes). The good news? The reward seems that much better after all of the hard work.
Other Primates will inevitably cross your path.
Uganda is a primate-lovers dream. In addition to mountain gorillas, Mgahinga is home to another endangered species: the golden monkey. These furry, comical monkeys live high up in bamboo forests. Tracking golden monkeys is very similar to tracking gorillas, but the trek itself is not quite as challenging.
Further afield, Bwindi has Lhoest monkeys, gray-cheeked mangabeys, and blue monkeys. In Kibale Forest National Park, chimpanzees steal the show. Patas monkeys roam around Murchison Falls National Park. Queen Elizabeth National Park has blue monkeys and red-tailed monkeys (not to mention non-primates, like lions and elephants).

Celebrated choreographer and teacher Silas Farley, recently retired as a dancer with the New York City Ballet and now serving as dean of dance at The Colburn School in Los Angeles, will join the residency and workshop a new Company commission set to the music of Shakespearean-era composer John Dowland.
The residency will last the first two weeks of August, coinciding with Weeks Six and Seven of Chautauqua's nine-week season of summer programming. We couldn't be more thrilled to finally bring The Washington Ballet to Chautauqua after a two-year pandemic delay, and especially in such an expansive and robust way,"" said Deborah Sunya Moore, senior vice president and chief program officer of Chautauqua Institution.
""What an amazing opportunity for our young dance students and dance-loving Chautauqua audiences to experience and learn from these performers with one of the nation's elite ballet companies. And we're particularly proud to welcome back Chautauqua School of Dance alum Silas Farley, where he'll reconnect with a community that is committed to fostering new choreography and catalyzing the creative process.""
Organized collaboratively by TWB Artistic Director Julie Kent and Chautauqua School of Dance Interim Director Sasha Janes, TWB's residency will showcase a number of the company's dancers and studio dancers in performance and as part of classes, discussions and talk backs with Company and Institution artistic leadership.

The 74-piece Chautauqua Symphony Orchestra will perform on select works and additional repertoire will be announced.
""As a young dancer, I first experienced the generative force that is Chautauqua as a trainee and then as a principal dancer. After my son was born, I would bring him to Chautauqua when I taught. Every memory I have of Chautauqua is full of warmth and freedom and a sense of community - the lifeblood of creativity,"" said Kent, who studied at Chautauqua in 1983. ""The Washington Ballet is thrilled to make its Chautauqua debut, and we're particularly excited that Silas Farley will be joining us. We are grateful for the invitation to create and share at such an esteemed and magical place.""

BCL will have a big presence at this weeks Austin-based festival to show off its work, featuring a Web3 experience devoted to Dolly Parton called welcometodollyverse.com.

59,Avalanche Studios CEO: 'Xbox Game Pass Has Been Really Great For Us',"208
Image: Avalanche Studios
Avalanche Studios, the team behind the Just Cause series and the upcoming Xbox Series X|S exclusive Contraband has opened up about the joys of Xbox Game Pass. According to a recent interview with the studio's CEO Pim Holfve, ""Game Pass has been really great for [them].""
Holfve was speaking to Gamesindustry.bizabout the company's current titles in the service such as Just Cause 4and theHunter: Call of the Wild Focusing on the latter, Holfve said their ""service model"" has worked due to Xbox Game Pass. The game is claimed to have hit seven million players since its release and is still seeing around one million active players per-month.
Holfve also added that Game Pass has been a ""good way"" for people to check out the game, and as a result, purchase a variety of available DLCs. The closing thought was that ""it's made Xbox a way more important platform than [they] ever initially thought.""
""Game Pass has been really great for us, especially if we look at our self-published title. TheHunter: Call of the Wild helped us prove our service model and Xbox Game Pass was fantastic because we were able to reach so many more players. It's a good way for people to try [the game], and since we have such a massive DLC catalogue for that title  over 20 DLCs  it's a beautiful way of getting people in, getting engaged and showing that it's a stellar game. Then people are really tempted to buy more. So the business model really works to our advantage.""
Holfve added that working with Xbox on Contraband ""made a lot of sense"" due to the ""grandness"" of the game. It's said to ""not [be] a concept [they] would pitch to every publisher"". Being a first-party title means they also have a lot of support, especially considering the game is arriving into Xbox Game Pass on day one.
""We've had a great relationship with Microsoft, and working with a first party has been intriguing as well, seeing what that actually means in terms of support and getting closer to the hardware. It's a new type of partnership for us. We've had fantastic partnerships with Square Enix, Bethesda and Warner Bros, but those are not the same as first-party.""
There's no confirmed release date for Contraband yet, and all we've been privy to is a short teaser trailer, but it's sounding to be a pretty ambitious title. It's claimed to be an Xbox Series X|S exclusive due to the upgraded Apex engine being utilised for it, which is a ""brand-new version with a lot of 'special sauce' added.""
At the time of its reveal, it was said the game would ""take full advantage of the unique capabilities of Xbox Series X|S"". It's unclear how, but it's lining up to be the developer's biggest title yet. Let's wait and see if they stick the landing.

60,Inovo Raises 54m For Polands Rising Tech Stars,"New York Legalized CannabisHeres What Entrepreneurs Predict Will Happen Next
The calibre of investors in Inovo underlines this reputation, with a range of global funds, entrepreneurs and family offices joining the European Investment Fund, the cornerstone investor, in this latest fundraising. The fund is already committed to a number of investment opportunities working alongside prominent international investors including Andreessen Horowitz, Hoxton Ventures and Point Nine Capital.
Swiebodas task now, as he sees it, is not only to deploy Inovo IIs new cash successfully  he expects to have done so by the end of next year  but also to provide further support for the broader start-up community. The firm is already known for its work with Polish entrepreneurs  not only investee businesses  offering advice and support ranging from tuition from experts on how to run a company to a regular podcast with helpful tips.
One of our investee companies described us as a Swiss Army knife for founders, he says proudly. But it is for our benefit too  if we can help build a stronger and broader ecosystem of technology start-ups in Poland, that will give us a deeper pool of potential investments.
Pipeline will be important to Inovos future success. The firm invested in 40% of the top technology company seed rounds last year and has a good record of helping portfolio businesses to raise follow-on funding. But it needs more stories such as Booksy, the international beauty platform that it has backed from the start; Booksys global success has seen it become one of Polands first technology unicorns and Inovo remains invested. Swieboda believes the country  and the broader CEE region, where Inovo will also source opportunities  can generate many more such companies.
Bringing that potential to fruition will require Inovo to keep reaching out to entrepreneurs. A lack of investment capital in Poland has sometimes forced founders to embrace a bootstrapping approach to growth, and it may be that some entrepreneurs have yet to fully appreciate how funding could accelerate their trajectories.
Nevertheless, Swieboda thinks it is now time to push on. The tech ecosystem in the CEE region is growing at an exceptional pace - in Poland the growth rate is 70% year-on-year, he says. In 2020, almost 500m in venture capital was deployed to 300 companies, which will almost certainly grow this year. It is our expectation that this decade will produce 10 unicorns and a few decacorns from Poland.

Nandi Bushell has shared yet another stunning cover, this time showcasing her skills on the guitar. The 11-year-old musical prodigys most recent rendition sees her take on Jimi Hendrixs1967 track Little Wing.
The rendition follows Bushlls recent drum cover of Rushs Tom Sawyer. Prior to that, she offered up covers of Billie Eilishs Happier Than Ever, Tools Forty Six & 2, Gimme Shelter by The Rolling Stones, Numb by Linkin Park, Duality by Slipknot, and a rollicking cover of Ed Sheeran and Bring Me The Horizons new collaboration, Bad Habits.
In a caption below the video post, Bushell wrote: Peace, Love and Respect! This is Little Wing by Jimi Hendrix, one of my favourite Hendrix tunes, Bushell wrote on Twitter, sharing a clip of her cover. I have spent this week relaxing, off school, and jamming my Fender guitar.
Earlier in January, Bushell joined forces with Tom Morello, Julien Baker and more for the charity single God Help Us All. Released in collaboration with The Miraculous Love Kids, a non-profit organisation that teaches music to young Afghan girls, the single sees Morello, Baker, Bushell, and a class of girls cover Morellos Nightwatchmen track.
Looking to the future, Bushell has said that shed like to jam with Billie Eilish and perhaps a little less realistically become the Prime Minister of Great Britain. Last year, the young musician released an original song titled The Children Will Rise Up. This rallying call for climate action saw Bushell team up with Tom Morellos son Roman, with his dad helping the pair to record the track.
At just eleven years old, Bushell already has more collaborations under her belt than most professional musicians. These include team-ups with Queens Roger Taylor, Beatles icon Ringo Starr and the Arctic Monkeys Matt Helders, alongside a live performance in LA with the
Foo Fighters.

64,The Navy Tried to Recreate the F-14 Tomcat Several Times. It Failed.,"A/F-X
follow-on program.
The Navys F/A-XX program could be used to fill the services air superiority gapwhich has essentially been left open since the F-14s retirement and the demise of the NATF and A/F-X programs. But the problem is that the Navy is pursuing the F/A-XX as a multirole Super Hornet replacement rather than an air superiority-oriented machine. The danger in its development is that it suboptimizes the fighter role in the quest for a hybrid fighter/attack jet, the Hudson Institute report notes. This would leave the Joint Force without a carrier-based sixth generation air superiority fighter.
As the Navys current director of air warfare, Rear Adm. Mike Manazir, has
stated in the past
, the authors also note that such an aircraft could feature large passive and active sensor arrays, relatively high cruising speed (albeit not necessarily acceleration), could hold a large internal weapons bay capable of launching numerous missiles, and could have space to adopt future technologies, such as HPM [high-powered microwaves] and lasers. This air superiority asset would contribute to Outer Air Battle integrated air and missile defense requirements and would be capable of countering enemy weapons, aircraft, and sensor and targeting nodes at a distance.
Outer Air Battle, of course, refers to a Navy concept from the 1980s to fend off a concerted attack by hordes of Soviet Tupolev Tu-22M Backfire bombers, Oscar-class (Project 949A Antey) nuclear-powered guided missile submarines and surface action groups lead by warships like the Kirov-class nuclear-powered battlecruisersas now deputy defense secretary Bob Work [he was the CEO of the Center for a New American Security at the time] described to me in 2013. These Soviet assets would have launched their arsenals of anti-ship cruise missiles from multiple points of the compass.
As Work described it, the Navy was relatively confident it could sink the Oscars and surface ships before they could launch their missiles. They were far less confident about their ability to take out the Tu-22Ms before they could get into launch position. The Tomcats, under Outer Air Battle, would try to kill the archersthe Backfiresbefore they could shoot and attempt to eliminate any cruise missiles that they launched. But, Work notes, no one knows how well it would have worked during a shooting war with the Soviet Unionand its a good thing we never got to find out. But with Chinas emerging anti-access/area denial strategy, the threat is back.
While the F/A-XX and the Air Forces F-X are in their infancy, it has become clear that they will be different aircraft designs that will probably share common technologies. The Navy does seem to be focusing on a more
defensive F-14 like concept while
the Air Force is looking for a more offensively oriented air superiority platform that could replace the Lockheed Martin F-22 Raptor. As you'll see over the coming years, the differences between the primary mission and the likely threats will drive significant differences between the F/A-XX and F-X programs as well as legacy systems like the F-22 and F-35, one senior defense official told me.

66,Understanding The Difference: Standard Auto Insurance Vs. ATV Insurance,"www.insuranceneighbor.com
All-terrain vehicles come with risks, and they can be expensive to replace when damaged in a crash. If you have an ATV, you wont be able to rely on your car insurance to protect you. ATVs are not covered by standard auto insurance policies. Also, ATV insurance may be required by law if you ride in certain areas, such as state parks. On the upside, you may qualify for a discount if you bundle your auto and ATV insurance policies with the same company.
How Is An ATV Defined?
Each state has a specific definition of an all-terrain vehicle. Generally, an ATV is considered to be a motorized vehicle with two or more wheels meant for off-road driving. These vehicles are not intended for use on roads or highways. Most people think of ATVs as single-passenger, four-wheeled, off-road vehicles. However, there are also all-terrain vehicles designed for two passengers, and some with more or fewer than four wheels.
When Is ATV Insurance Required?
You may be required to carry bodily injury and property damage liability insurance, depending on where you ride your ATV. As these vehicles are not street-legal, there are no state minimum insurance coverage requirements. Nevertheless, many state-owned parks and lands only allow ATV riders who have ATV liability insurance.
What Does ATV Insurance Cover?
Most insurers cover ATVs under motorcycle insurance policies. Coverages under a typical ATV insurance policy may include:
Bodily injury liability: This covers damages associated with injury or death to other parties involved in an accident with your ATV. It will also cover legal fees resulting from litigation against you arising from such an incident.
Property damage liability: This insurance pays for the cost of any damage a driver of your ATV may cause to someone elses property. Coverage extends to personal belongings, as well as the home or yard of another person.
Medical payments (optional): Medical coverage pays for medical expenses incurred by someone who is injured while riding your ATV, including you or your family members.
Collision (optional): If your ATV overturns or gets in a collision with another vehicle, collision coverage will pay to repair the damages.
Comprehensive (optional): Comprehensive coverage pays for damage to your ATV not caused by a collision with another vehicle. It covers losses from theft, vandalism, fires, earthquakes, flooding, and other perils.
Uninsured/underinsured motorist (optional): If you or someone riding your ATV is injured by someone who is uninsured or underinsured, this coverage will pay for your expenses.
ATV Insurance Policy Exclusions
When you purchase ATV insurance, you should be aware of certain circumstances that are excluded from coverage. For example, standard ATV insurance policies will not cover damages or losses related to organized racing, or accidents that occur on roads or highways where ATVs are not permitted.
Our friendly agent can help you find the best available rates for the ATV insurance coverage you need. We can also explain the exclusions, so you know which situations to avoid to maintain your protection.

A HAMPSHIRE care service where staff ""miss visits"" has been told it is ""not always safe"" and people are ""at risk"".
Laburnum House Extra Care, run by Radis Community Care, is a service providing personal care and support to people living in specialist 'extra care' housing in Hedge End.
The service has 51 flats and bungalows with on-site staff who are present 24/7.
The service had an inspection on February 18 this year, and the findings were published by the CQC on May 27 giving the home an over all rating of ""requires improvement"".
The report found that three out of five categories used to determine the rating all require improvement, and the two others were rated as good.
Inspectors found that the service was not always safe and that there was a risk people of being harmed.
Inspectors were told that there were times when staff had missed visits.
They said, ""I ring up if they don't turn up"" and ""It used to be really organised but the last few months it hasn't been.
""My son spoke with staff. They told him I wasn't on the computer, so we'll see how it goes. I find it a worry.""
Another resident said that sometime staff would be late to visits which would cause their medicines to be late.
They added: ""This means my pain has built up and I then can't have them at the set times."" They also told us, ""I'm epileptic so it's important I have my (medicine) at the right time to keep the fits under control.""
It was also found that since the last inspection, while some improvements were made, training records were still incomplete.
Three staff records indicated they had received safeguarding training in August 2017 but no refresher training since then.
For another staff member who started in 2017 there was no record of training in safeguarding or moving and handling.

The MotorHomes body was also something special. An aluminum body frame extruded from the steel ladder frame. From it, fiberglass panels made up the lower portion while more aluminum was up top.

GM designer Paul Deesen gave the MotorHome a body ripped from the pages of science fiction and the good looks were complemented with huge windows that offered great visibility and an airy feel in the interior.

All of this rode on front independent torsion bars with double A-arms. In back were trailing arms with an air spring on each side between the tandem axles.
The addition of an air suspension not only meant a softer ride, but allowed the driver to make leveling adjustments when the MotorHome was parked. The rear wheels were pushed out to the outside of the frame. And since there werent chunky axles back there, the rigs two 25-gallon fuel tanks were fitted in the empty space.

All of this work made for an RV that was just eight feet tall without counting a rooftop air-conditioner. They came in two lengths with a 23-foot model and a 26-foot model. The 23-footer weighed just 10,500 lb while the 26 came in at 12,500 lb.

And the interiors were solidly planted in the era in which they were built. Check out the interior of this 1973 model for sale on Bring a Trailer.

The patterned upholstery isnt original, but it certainly adds to the look.
Amenities in a GMC MotorHome are nothing special, but it includes everything from a ducted furnace and a 44.5 lb propane tank to 30 gallons of fresh water storage and 30 gallons of wastewater storage. Yep, you even got a bathroom and options for a generator. The MotorHome even had a marine water heater that provided hot water on the move using engine coolant loops.

Prices ran $13,569.06 for the 23-foot model and $14,569.06 for the 26-foot MotorHome. Thats $92,820.29 and $99,660.88 in todays money, respectively. GM produced 12,921 MotorHomes between 1972 and 1978. One of them is the brown and orange 26-foot RV featured here.

You might wonder why production ever stopped if they were such a great idea. Well, remember how I said that it took two GM divisions to make the MotorHome happen?
MotorHome production counted on the UPP drivetrain, and when it went away in favor of smaller transverse drivetrains, the MotorHome had nothing to power it. So, in 1977 the Truck & Coach Division announced the end of the MotorHome.

76,High-flow nasal oxygen therapy for COVID-19 is easier to use helps decrease inflammation,"content powered by
So far, more than 3 million cases of COVID-19 infection have been reported in India. While many patients are experiencing mild symptoms, old aged people and those with comorbidities often suffer from severe symptoms of COVID-19 which include severe breathlessness, pain in the chest, delirium and bluish discolouration of the face and lips. These patients require oxygen therapy for breathing which is provided either in the form of oxygen masks, high flow nasal oxygen via a cannula or mechanical ventilation. Due to the inefficiency of oxygen masks in COVID-19 related breathlessness and the lack of sufficient ventilators, doctors have been using high-flow nasal oxygen therapy to take care of the respiratory complications of COVID-19 infection.
What is high-flow nasal oxygen therapy?
High-flow nasal oxygen therapy, also known as HFNO, is a type of oxygen therapy that can deliver 37C heated and 100% humidified oxygen at a flow of 60 litres per minute via nasal prongs or cannula, which are fitted to patient's nostrils.
The oxygen flow meter is attached to an oxygen blender and gas analyser, which makes sure that precise oxygen delivery is being given to the patient. The maximum gas flow rates can be from 40 to 60 litre per minute, whereas the heating and the humidifying system delivers gases at temperatures between 33C and 43C and humidity from 95% to 100%.
Benefits of high-flow nasal oxygen therapy
There are various advantages of HFNO over other modes of oxygen therapy. Some of them are:
1. HFNO is better than an oxygen mask and is easy to use, unlike a ventilator which requires expertise to handle.
2. Unlike other oxygen therapy measures, which use dry oxygen, HFNO provides warm and humidified oxygen to the body. This helps in maintaining the bodys temperature, decreases the inflammation in the airway and maintains mucociliary clearance, which is the cleaning mechanism of the respiratory tract.
3. The high-flow nasal oxygen therapy is non-invasive and is convenient for patients as people on HFNO therapy are awake, so they can talk, eat and drink.
4. The high-flow nasal oxygen cannula is lighter than other non-invasive ventilation modes such as BiPAP machines, which are usually given to the people suffering from sleep apnea.
5. Nasal cannulae are disposable, reducing the chance of getting infected, which is quite high in patients using an oxygen mask.
6. A high-flow nasal cannula is priced at Rs 5,000 which can last for two weeks, while the charge of a ventilator can be ten times more for a single day.
Disadvantages of high-flow nasal oxygen therapy
There are a few disadvantages of high-flow nasal oxygen therapy, which include:
1. HFNO cannot be used in severe cases as it does not deliver high-pressure oxygen to the lungs.
2. HFNO cannot be used on patients who cannot breathe on their own.
3. HFNO works best on patients who do not require a lot of oxygen to keep their saturation levels at 90%.

79,Medtronic's Plan to Reduce Hospital Readmissions -- The Motley,"Nov 1, 2013 at 3:31PM
Medical device maker Medtronic
NYSE:MDT
)
believes there's big money to be made from helping health care providers comply with regulatory mandated reductions in hospital readmission rates.
As a result, Medtronic paid $200 million for privately held Cardiocom this past summer. That bet gives Medtronic turnkey share in the telehealth industry -- a growing market bridging acute and primary care for patients with chronic conditions like heart disease.
Regulatory focus on improving outcomes
The interest in Cardiocom likely stems from a provision in the Affordable Care Act that penalizes hospitals unable, or unwilling, to embrace policies and procedures geared at reducing readmissions.
According to the Centers for Medicaid and Medicare, or CMS, some 20% of Medicare patients are readmitted within 30 days of discharge, and those readmissions cost Medicare more than $15 billion every year.
To reduce those readmission costs, the ACA instituted fines for hospitals with high readmission rates. In August, CMS announced 2,225 hospitals are being fined a combined $227 million for 2013, equal to 1% of their reimbursements. That's likely to get the industry's attention.  Particularly given penalties will climb to as high as 3% in 2015 and expand beyond heart attack, heart failure, and pneumonia patients to also include chronic lung disease, elective hip and knee replacements starting next October.
In steps Medtronic
Medtronic thinks one of the ways providers will look to cut readmissions is by deploying telehealth products and services like those offered by Cardiocom.  If so, Medtronic's large presence in cardiac care gives it a big network of customers to cross-sell.
Those customers are increasingly collaborating with home health care industry participants like Amedisys
(
NASDAQ:AMED
)
to cut costs and reduce readmission rates. However, Amedisys and its peers are facing its own cost pressures tied to Medicare and Medicaid reimbursement rates. That's pressuring the industry to lower its own costs, which supports their use of telehealth solutions.
According to a 2006 study by the University of Minnesota, virtual visits between a skilled home health care nurse and chronically ill patients at home can improve patient outcome at lower cost than traditional skilled face-to-face home health care visits.
Since players like Amedisys can deliver at-home care at a cost of one tenth that of a hospital stay, they offer a compelling solution for commercial and government insurers.  According to a study of Veterans Health Administration patients, the VHA found telehealth technology reduced bed days of care by 25% and readmissions by 20%.
Source: Almost Family investor presentation.
If Medtronic's is right that health care will increasingly shift to the home, it will expand the company's reach considerably. Only 13% of the 7.5 million heart failure patients in the United States are right for cardiac implants.  By providing telehealth solutions, Medtronic may end up serving millions of additional patients.
Other companies vying for business
Cardiocom controls 12.5% of the market for patient home monitoring, making it the second largest player an industry expected to grow to $395 million by 2017 from $182 million in 2012, according to Frost & Sullivan.
But, Cardiocom isn't alone in the marketplace.  It's in a footrace with other competitors, including Honeywell's
(
NYSE:HON
)
HomMed unit, which is tucked into Honeywell's Automation and Control Solutions division. According to Honeywell, patients using HomMed's telehealth solutions total more than all other competitors, including Cardiocom, combined. That makes Honeywell a big player in this fast growing market and suggests Medtronic will have to work hard to differentiate its own offering.
Medtronic will also compete with Bosch Healthcare and Philips NV in the home telehealth market.
The Foolish final take
Medtronic's strategy to expand its product line into telehealth appears to dovetail nicely with the company's current cardiac focus. It also offers Medtronic other opportunities given that Cardiocom's product line includes glucose monitors for diabetes patients, which is another of Medtronic's existing markets.
Of course, there's always the risk that the regulatory or competitive landscape will derail the potential opportunity. Medtronic will also need to continue to innovate and lean on its provider network if it wants to wrestle share away from industry heavyweight Honeywell, which could weigh on margins. However, despite those challenges the move into new adjacent addressable markets provides an opportunity for growth and that's never a bad thing.

/PRNewswire/ -- eSimplify Enterprises, Inc., a SaaS based practice analytics company for small to mid-sized primary care practices, today announced the availability of its new patent pending analytics platform and dashboard that enables providers to thrive under Medicare's new preventive services guidelines. As Medicare and 3

A free version of the platform is available for individual providers to gain visibility into their patient population. The free version identifies preventive services, who should receive them, and the associated revenue impact as well as identifying potential improvements in value based incentive scores and payments. The premium version enables physician groups to get full visibility to all preventive services for both the group and individual providers.

82,Napoleonic residence in Milan to be discovered,"MILAN The Weather in Palazzina Appiani, in Milan, is located in the Brera Design District, a stones throw from the Arena Civica of Parco Sempione. The building was built to accommodate the grandstand for Napoleons public appearances and is in fact called the Royal Loggia. With its classical forms, it hosts on the first floor the Hall of Honor with friezes running along the entire ceiling and which want to reproduce Roman bas-reliefs from the imperial age. You can also admire two large crystal chandeliers. According to documents and historical artifacts, when in 1796 the French troops led by Napoleon broke into Milan, a brief but intense political and civil season began for the city which saw it as the protagonist of great plans destined to give it a metropolitan and cultural dimension worthy of a capital. Architecture too had to respond to this need for change and transformation with projects that celebrated the magnificence of Napoleonic power. The urban reorganization of the vast area around the Castello Sforzesco became its emblem: it was conceived as a large parade ground, even equipped with a triumphal arch the Arco della Pace and an arena for public performances, designed in 1805 by Luigi Canonica on the model of the ancient Roman circuses. Today the Civic Arena is one of the few buildings left as evidence of Napoleons ambitious plans, who also wanted a tribune of honor here for his public appearances. Thus arose a loggia with monumental classical forms open on the amphitheater and included in a building with simple and compact lines, which faces the external front on the park with an already neoclassical porticoed facade. Inside, a Hall of honor decorated with marble, crystals and a continuous frieze that evokes the triumphal processions of the Roman bas-reliefs of the imperial age, painted in the manner of the neoclassical painter Andrea Appiani from whom the Palazzina takes its name. Palazzina Appiani has been a property under FAI concession since 2015. The structure opens to the public with guided tours and events often dedicated to children to discover and enjoy a neoclassical jewel immersed in the greenery and history of Milan.

Disney Star deploys new technologies to enhance IPL 2022 broadcast
The tech innovations have been developed by Star Lab - the R&D arm of Disney Star.
29 Mar, 2022 - 06:12 PM IST | By indiantelevision.com Team
Mumbai: Disney Star has announced a slew of technological innovations to enhance IPL 2022 broadcast on the network.
These technologies, adopted across Star Sports network and streaming platform Disney+ Hotstar, have been spearheaded by Disney Stars R&D arm Star Lab which develops innovation in emerging technologies.
The broadcaster has brought the immersive sound of Dolby Atmos to fans, unique online voting, and polling platform, enhanced analytics in the commentary box, mixed reality analysis, a behind-the-scenes (BTS) technology venture and the robot assistant Cricko. However, only Star Sports1 HD and Star Sports1 Hindi HD will be integrated with the Dolby Atmos experience. Viewers will experience multidimensional sound with incredible clarity that allows them to hear details never heard before during the live sporting action, according to the statement.
Disney Star has been committed to elevating the experience of Tata IPL, bringing millions of viewers closer to the game, the heroes, and the action, said Disney Star head sports Sanjog Gupta. With fans being allowed in the stadium, we wanted viewers to get as close to the real feel of the atmosphere at the venues and this is why we decided to produce the Tata IPL 2022 in Dolby Atmos for the first time. The Star Lab has also enhanced the presentation of the tournament by deploying AR and VR across match coverage and programming initiatives. We will also experiment with the worlds first interactive cricket show in the metaverse, in our ambition of making this the most interactive and immersive season of Tata IPL.
Online voting and polling platform through megaphone:
Star Sports is introducing a new online voting and polling platform. It will deliver a live and interactive experience that will allow viewers to shape the editorial discourse during shows and build a connection between the opinions of Star Sports experts and audiences.
Mixed reality analysis:
Presenters will be able to visualise and interact with data-driven Hawkeye graphics using an MR headset, proprietary technology developed in-house by Star Lab.
Enhanced analytics:
With enhanced analytics in the commentary box, commentators will be teleported from the ground to the studios.
BTS tech venture:
A new BTS tech venture will be the implementation of cloud production. Cloud workflows and distributed production models have been accelerated by the global chip shortage. Eliminating hardware and geographical location dependencies means more resources can be deployed into creating quality content and storytelling and collaboration is accelerated which will result in benefits to the environment by reducing carbon emissions.
Other enhancements include ball-by-ball fielding analysis linked to live on-ground player tracking, enabled within digital twins of stadiums as well as 3D player avatars, virtual multi-screen telestration, and a bespoke virtual studio environment that leverages a stereoscopic talent positional tracking system to create the magical illusion that the graphics are real, 3D physical objects.
The robot assistant Cricko is armed with a huge database of IPL facts and figures to ensure analysts are equipped with the most up-to-date and in-depth statistics to share with audiences.
The media company will continue to leverage the power of the unreal gaming engine to create virtual studios and augmented reality graphics. AR graphics will be enabled on drone cameras flying high above the stadium, said the statement.

LISTEN
OCT 15, 2020
The Minister of Sanitation and Water Resources, Cecilia Abena Dapaah has revealed that the nine-month coronavirus-induced free water supply to Ghanaians will cost government GHS 834 million.
At the initial stages of the Coronavirus pandemic in Ghana, the government announced three-month free water for Ghanaians.
The relief was extended by another three months. This was announced by the Minister of Finance, Ken Ofori-Atta on Thursday, July 23, 2020, when he presented the 2020 mid-year budget review in Parliament.
The Water Resources Ministry in a statement dated Wednesday, September 23, 2020, announced a further extension of the policy till the end of the year.
Speaking at the 2020 Global Handwashing Day Commemoration in Accra, Ms. Dapaah said The free water policy is costing the country close to GHS 834 million at the end of the 9 months, ending December 2020. The high cost of the Free Water policy cannot be equated to the number of lives saved through effective and proper handwashing with soap under running water during the COVID-19 pandemic.
This singular most important social intervention is to make potable water easily accessible and at no cost to all, to allow for effective and proper handwashing with soap under running water, she added.
Ms. Dapaah also outlined additional interventions made by the Ministry together with its partners to promote handwashing among Ghanaians.
We distributed over 1500 units of handwashing facilities and accompanying logistics to critical and vulnerable groups of society namely, Health facilities, Mental Homes, Foster Homes, Lorry Parks, Basic and Secondary Schools, to support effective handwashing.
She urged Ghanaians to prioritize handwashing with soap.
As we commemorate the Global Handwashing Day to promote and give visibility to handwashing with soap in Ghana, let me say that promoting health is one of the important steps towards development and a better quality of life. To make this occasion a memorable one, I wish to appeal to all and sundry to make handwashing with soap a priority.
Together we can save lives in Ghana by promoting handwashing with soap. Let us all resolve today to sustain washing hands with soap particularly at the critical times especially after visiting the toilet and handling food, she added.
The Unicef Representative for Ghana, Anne-Claire Dufay addressing the gathering after handing over some handwashing materials to the Ministry called on stakeholders to follow suit.
Today we are pleased to hand-over additional Veronica Buckets and other hygiene supplies to the Ministry of Education and the Ghana Education Service for onward distribution to schools in the Greater Accra Region. We would also like to take this opportunity to invite all stakeholders to invest in water, sanitation, and hygiene, as this is critical for Ghana to fight COVID-19 and make more progress towards the Sustainable Development Goals.

85,10 Manga to Read If You Liked Alita: Battle Angel,"Black Magic
started as essentially a fan project (or doujinshi) before becoming a cult classic in the '80s manga scene.
The story deals with out-of-control cyborgs on a destructive mission, and only the military can stop them. It's a very straightforward story, but the dated violence and incredible passion Shirow Masamune devotes to bringing his vision to life gives Black Magic a real classic feel. It's not Masamune's best work (we'll get to that), but it remains a classic worth visiting. And it's short. If you liked Alita: Battle Angel, perhaps you should visit this, as it helped lay the groundwork in cyberpunk manga that Yukito Kishiro would later follow.

Biomega
Tsutomu Nihei is most famous for creating Blame!, but it would be foolish to discount him as a one-trick pony. If anything, some would argue Biomega is a superior effort.
Biomega is the story of a man and his motorcycle (and the AI mechanically bound to his motorcycle) traveling down the sprawl of urbanized civilization to track down individuals who have been infected with a nanomachine virus that turns them into zombies. What makes Biomega so fascinating is, like Blame!, how nihilistic it all feels. Cities go on for what feels like an eternity, but, again, society feels empty. As the manga continues, this oppressive nihilism becomes downright haunting.
RELATED:
Cyberpunk manga like Battle Angel Alita and Biomega seem to argue that, once mankind dies away, all that will remain is a technological grave marker for civilization.

Chobits
Chobits is a delightful story about a man falling in love with his personal computer.
CLAMP may be far more popular for fantasy manga like Cardcaptor Sakura and Tsubasa, but Chobits might be their most powerful work of genre fiction. It starts off feeling like any old comedic manga. Loser stumbles upon a Persocom -- a personal computer shaped like a beautiful girl. However, the machine he finds, Chii, is a bizarre machine that remembers nothing of her past and may be capable of synthetic intelligence.
The story is definitely far more comedic than almost everything here, but there are dramatic questions about the nature of humanity, memory, and personal value at play here. Worth re-examining.

Appleseed
Shirow Masamune returns. Appleseed is a four-volume manga. It introduces audiences to a militarized police task force assigned to handle militaristic assignments to preserve the fragile status of the few remaining city states in a post-WWIII environment... and the two LAPD officers thrown in the deep end as new recruits.
RELATED:
10 Great Anime Movies (That Arent Studio Ghibli)
What Appleseed does so well is it combines cyberpunk action with real questions of political and sociological importance. The story resonated well with audiences, as it inspired several adaptations over the years. OVAs, anime films, video games -- you name it. If not for that other cyberpunk manga Shirow Masamune is famous for (we'll get to it!), this would be remembered as his greatest achievement.

Marcus Rashford is launching a book club with a focus on encouraging disadvantaged children to read.
The Manchester United player said he wished he had the chance to read more as a child but books were not something his family could 'budget for'.
Instead, they had to prioritise buying food.
The England star has teamed up with Macmillan Childrens Books for the project.
The company said a key aim will be getting books into the hands of children from vulnerable and under-privileged backgrounds.
Rashford, from Wythenshawe, has drawn widespread praise for his work to highlight child food poverty.

Speaking of his latest project, Rashford said: I only started reading at 17, and it completely changed my outlook and mentality.
I just wish I was offered the opportunity to really engage with reading more as a child, but books were never a thing we could budget for as a family when we needed to put food on the table.
There were times where the escapism of reading could have really helped me.
""I want this escapism for all children. Not just those that can afford it.
We know there are over 380,000 children across the UK today that have never owned a book, children that are in vulnerable environments. That has to change.

My books are, and always will be, for every child, even if I have to deliver them myself. We will reach them.
The first title of the partnership is YOU ARE A CHAMPION: Unlock Your Potential, Find Your Voice And Be The BEST You Can Be  an illustrated non-fiction title aimed at young people aged 11-16.
It will be published in May 2021.
Each chapter will begin with a story from Rashfords own life and will cover topics such as the value of education, positive mentality, understanding culture, and female role models.

Posted On April 29, 2020 15:47:22
VA is partnering with four technology organizations CaringBridge, IBM, Objective Zero Foundation, and RallyPoint that share VAs commitment to preventing veteran suicide. These organizations are working with VA to promote social connectedness and expand the reach of lifesaving resources using mobile applications and online platforms.
Partnerships are a vital component of the National Strategy for Preventing Veteran Suicide, which we are implementing at the national, state, and local levels, said Dr. Keita Franklin, executive director, suicide prevention, for VAs Office of Mental Health and Suicide Prevention. Our goal is to prevent suicide among veterans nationwide and across the globe, reaching even those who do not, and may never, come to VA for care. To do that, we are working closely with dozens of important partners across sectors to expand our reach beyond VA facility walls, to deliver care and support to at-risk veterans wherever they live, work, and thrive.
As identified in the national strategy, engaging community partners in the technology sector is an important component of VAs public health approach to suicide prevention. While each of our technology partners offers their own unique services, they all use technology to help service members and veterans get the care they need whenever and wherever they need it.

While enhancing social connectedness, CaringBridge also allows its users to conduct personal fundraisers. Through the partnership with VA and CaringBridge, a tailored destination page www.caringbridge.org/military-service/ to directly focus on the needs of Service members, veterans, caregivers and their families is now available.
IBM
IBM and VA launched a collaborative suicide prevention program to develop an innovative mobile application currently under development titled GRIT (Getting Results In Transition). GRIT demonstrates how the real-time and consistent collection of personalized data can help service members and veterans understand and strengthen their emotional well-being and resiliency particularly during the transition from active duty to civilian life. GRIT allows users to create a digital self and gain personal insight into their personality baseline, provides access to a digital assistant powered by IBM Watson, helps to build a squad of social connection and offers employment matching and fulfillment capabilities using IBM Watson Employment Manager among other resources to support the transition out of the military.

93,Will informatics define the future of digital healthcare?,"email
Bob Gilkes, CEO of software firm Epro, discusses the benefits informatics could bring to the future of care delivery and the risks to take into account.
Epro is a UK software firm that supports digital healthcare and clinical solutions for the National Health Service (NHS). Its ultimate goal is to provide the NHS with a suite of global electronic patient record (EPR) providers at lower costs.
It was founded in 2001 by NHS clinician Dr Adam Tower to overcome the mountain of paperwork facing healthcare professionals. Its sheer volume led to inevitable errors.
In 2007, Epros first custome solution was commissioned; discharge summaries for the West Suffolk NHS Foundation Trust. Three years later, it became the first company to roll out NHS Drugs, Medicines + Devices (dm+d) dictionary into secondary care
Now, its solutions focus on everything from acute to mental health. In the early weeks of the Covid-19 pandemic, the company worked with Londons North West University Healthcare NHS Trust to improve staff and patient safety by highlighting infectious patients in real time, among other things, its COOpreviously told us.
According to its CEO, Bob Gilkes, Epro is on track to becoming an investable operation with expertise across software development, UI design, sales, marketing and professional and technical support services.
Bob Gilkes, CEO of Epro. Image: Epro
Why adopt informatics in healthcare?
According to Gilkes, the UKs National Audit Officeestimated earlier this year that the cost of the NHSs updated digital transformation strategy came to 8.1bn.
This is against a backdrop of healthcare provision already being an expensive investment, he said. But why? Because substantial sums can be wasted on repeat procedures, delays in care as well as costs in traditional methods of sharing data.
Gilkes explained that connected healthcare systems help reduce that wastage. This can include lab results being processed more quickly and fewer instances of malpractice claims, for example. Such systems depend on health informatics, which can help reduce errors, improve communication and drive efficiency.
But there are other benefits beyond reducing wastage, Gilkes continued. Healthcare providers are always learning more, and health informatics provides a way for knowledge about patients, diseases and new treatments to be more easily shared.
As knowledge is more readily circulated, the practice of medicine is improved for everyone involved from practitioner to patient.
How has Covid-19 impacted approaches to healthcare?
One of the biggest obstacles facing the NHS and other healthcare systems around the world right now is Covid-19. But the need for change existed long before the pandemic hit, Gilkes said: In many ways, the pandemic has just accelerated change that was already in the system.
Again, Gilkes believes that informatics should be employed in the global response to Covid. As healthcare becomes more specialised, he explained, there is also a greater need for coordination.
With a growing number of touchpoints for patients across multiple specialities and settings, the increase in specialists requires an increase in coordination, he said. And its health informatics that provides the way forward.
Unless those conversations are made in tandem with one another, problems will arise and care will suffer. Health informatics makes the necessary coordination possible.
The potential for informatics has shone a light on the many committed IT professionals working to respond to the pandemic, according to Gilkes. Alongside the commitment of frontline clinical staff, he said, those working in IT have shown considerable creativity and innovation in developing a time-critical response.
Considering the risks of digital healthcare
Clearly, the healthcares current trajectory is bringing together more disciplines than ever before. How will that impact the future of working in the field?
Gilkes believes that there may be a risk looming. We need to recognise that approaching patient care through information and technology poses the risk of making it less personal, he said.
As data is gathered regarding a patient, algorithms could sort it to determine what is wrong and promote a care pathway, he explained. It remains to be seen what effects this data-driven approach will have over time. Since care risks are getting less personal, having a valid and accurate record that the patient and their care providers can access remains vital.
So, in this emerging paradigm I hope that the relationship between the NHS and suppliers will become more symbiotic. The boundaries between client and vendor become more blurred.
Health informatics provides a way for knowledge about patients, diseases and new treatments to be more easily shared
BOB GILKES
How can we imbue our next steps with the right amount of caution? His advice is to remember the overarching mission of the field and to take stock along the way: There is little room for technology for technologys sake, nor gaining a sensation of safety by buying biggest.
Other industries have proven relationship-management roles which extend beyond traditional procurement; they explore innovation, promote learning and mitigate risk.
In reality, profit will continue to be an understandable commercial imperative for most, he added. But its crucial that technology providers subscribe to mission over margin.
There are few decisions that cannot be undone safely and the Covid response has freed a strongly collaborative, almost wartime response to innovation, he said. It is, however, unlikely that this rate of change can continue.
At some time, it is important to take stock, review what has and has not worked and do just a little tidying up. Hopefully the spirit will remain.

95,Health care center set to expand in former Bank of America complex in Belfast,"purchase the former Bank of America complex
off Route 3 in Belfast.
Thetransaction is major, with the property incorporating a 142-acre campus and seven buildings with 316,000 square feet of office space. The purchase means that Seaport Community Health Care Center in Belfast, which is part of PCHC, will be able to grow. More than that, though, the nonprofit organization is looking to use its new location to increase access to health care and fill wellness gaps in the community, although its at the early stages of figuring out what that will look like.
Its an incredibly exciting opportunity, for us and the whole community, Lori Dwyer, the president and chief executive officer of Penobscot Community Health Care, the largest federally qualified health center in Maine, said Tuesday. We really see ourselves as part of the community economic development plan.
Thesale is expected to breathe new life into a complex that once served as an economic engine for the region but has grown much quieter since its heyday in the early 2000s.
We have lots of thoughts, Dwyer said. Were exploring and researching the kind of aligned services that will be a good fit for that campus. None of this is definitive. I cant emphasize enough how much input well be seeking from the community.
The organization, which announced in July that it was under contract to purchase the campus, had a virtual real estate closing on Friday. It bought the property from current owner STAG IV Belfast LLC, part of real estate investment company Stag Capital of Boston. Prior to that, it was owned by Bank of America, which acquired it after buying MBNA in 2005.
Right now, PCHCs firm plans for the campus revolve around Building 5,a 72,000- square foot structure which will be renovated to be the new home for Seaport Community Health Center. The health center, which has 8,000 patients, now operates in a leased, 11,800- square foot building at 53 Schoodic Drive in Belfast, around the corner from the new property. It offers primary care, mental health services, recovery services, a pharmacy and more, and is bursting at the seams, according to officials, who said it needs to more than double its size to meet current and future needs.
Theres more than enough space in the new building, where the practice will occupy the first floor, with the second floor reserved for PCHC administrative and other uses. The organization has secured a federal grant to help with the renovations of the building, Dwyer said. Future services offered there will include dental care and expanded mental health and recovery programs.
The largest structure, Building 8, will continue to be occupied by Bank of America.
As for the development of the rest of the vacant office space and large campus, time will tell, she said. Ideas so far include a child care center and senior services.
I think the broader vision is focused on community wellness, Dwyer said, adding that the organization plans to work cooperatively with other health care providers such as Waldo County General Hospital. We want to work with them and work with other people to identify whats missing. We want to fill in the gaps.
Whatever happens, the campus is likely to look quite different than it did 20 years ago. At the height of MBNAs Belfast operations in the late 1990s and early 2000s, the company employed about 3,000 people there as debt collectors, call center workers and more, a number that equaled nearly half of the population of the midcoast city.
But things changed when Bank of America moved in. That companys much smaller workforce no longer needed the acres of climate-controlled cubicles, and sold part of the campus to Massachusetts-based athenahealth. The rest of the holdings eventually were sold to STAG IV. With some of the buildings empty or underused, the changing real estate reality led to a years-long dispute between STAG IV and the city of Belfast about the tax valuation for the property. In 2015, the city valued the property at $41 million, but after the city and the investment company came to an agreement in 2018, the assessed value has dropped to about a quarter of that sum.
STAG IV has remained one of the citys largest property taxpayers, nonetheless, paying $261,039 to Belfast last year.
In 2019, the company tried to sell the property at auction with bids starting at just $1.8 million, but itsreserve wasntmet so it wasnt sold.
Dwyer said that because her organization has a for-profit tenant at the property, the general rule that nonprofit organizations are exempt from paying property taxes does not applyto the property as a whole. She and others at the health care organization are looking forward to moving forward with renovations and plans. Were just excited, she said. Its a nice bright spot in the midst of this very gloomy pandemic.

96,North Alabama Medical Center opens new cancer treatment center,"Share on LinkedIn
FLORENCE, Ala. (WAFF) - North Alabama Medical Center has a new state-of-the-art cancer center.
When people walk through these doors they are dealing with some of the toughest moments in life: battling cancer.
I have been in awe with the bravery of my patients going through that process, said Oncologist. Vic Liengswangwong.
While his patients fight cancer, Oncologist Dr. Vic believes its important for patients to be close to friends and family.
One reason why North Alabama Medical Centers new cancer centers motto is High-Quality Care Close To Home, which is important since cancer has been the second leading cause of death in Alabama since 1966 according to the Alabama Department of Public Health.
Cancer takes a toll on every aspect of life. Both physically, mentally, and spiritually so having them be among friends and family is going to be very important, said Liengswangwong.
There have been 30 thousand estimated new cancer cases across the state of Alabama
In Lauderdale County, the average annual count of cancer cases is 527.
One of their state-of-the-art machines added to their cancer-fighting toolkit is a linear accelerator, a machine that is utilized to treat cancer by generating high-energy x-rays or electrons.
The precession and accuracy of radiation treatment delivery and the planning, they are so dependent on the technology that you have. The technology that we have here will allow us to offer the full spectrum of radiation treatment to the patient, said Liengswangwong.
These advances allow patients to be treated faster and with more certainty that the radiation is always targeting cancer.
As a physician and radiation oncologist, to be a part of patients care like this in a facility that allows us to not only offer them stand care but the cutting edge, top-notch care, is very meaningful to me, said Liengswangwong.
Beyond having radiation and medical oncology in one building, they also offer more services like surgery, supportive care, and physical therapy to help their patients.

The food is top notch. I started with the burrata ($13), a mix of cherry tomatoes, candied onions, salsa verde and levain bread with a large ball of cheese in the middle. My main course was Linguini Nero, which is made with squid-ink pasta, which turns the noodles black. It tastes similar to regular pasta, but the color adds a uniqueness to the dish, which also has shrimp, scallops, octopus, oil-cured tomato, garlic, pepper flakes and herbs. I finished the meal with a delectable budino ($10), which is similar to crme brulee. It has a caramelized brown sugar custard, pistachios and citrus notes.

98,"Somerset Care ordered to pay compensation following ""poor communication"" with elderly resident's family","privacy notice
A Somerset care home operator has been ordered to pay compensation after it failed to communicate properly with the family of an elderly resident.
The resident - known as Mr Y - lived at the Croft House Care Home on Bank Street in Williton which is operated by SomersetCare.
Mr Y's relative - known as Mrs X - complained to the Local Government and Social Care Ombudsman (LGSCO) after Mr Y's death in July 2020, arguing that he had received poor care and that staff had failed to keep the family updated about his condition.
READ MORE:
More than a year on from his death, the ombudsman has ordered Somerset Care to apologise and pay the family compensation in light of ""distress"" caused by its poor communication.
What happened to Mr Y?
A stock image of a social worker
(Image: Getty)
The ombudsman exists to investigate allegations of ""maladministration"" and ""service failure"" in the public sector  in other words, instances in which it is claimed councils have not fully carried out their legal duties to taxpayers.
Mr Y, who had dementia, complained to care home staff in April 2020 that he was feeling unwell, with a GP visiting him five times in the space of a month.
Staff and district nurses reviewed Mr Y's care plan in May, following concerns that he was having difficulty breathing - but his family was not involved in the review, with Mrs X claiming she was not contacted (a claim the care home disputes).
By early-June, Mr Y had loss five kilograms in weight and suffered his third fall since April, prompting a further review of his care plan - again without involving his family.
Mr Y's health continued to deteriorate as the month wore on, with the resident having a ""low mood"" and being prescribed antibiotics for a suspected infection following a further GP visit.
On June 22, Mr Y began to choke while eating his lunch; he was immediately placed on a ""soft diet"" and his care plan reviewed to ""reflect the recent deterioration in his mobility"" - with these changes once again not being relayed to the family.
By June 26, Mr Y was deemed to need end of life care, and he suffered a further fall the following day (about which his family were informed).
His condition deteriorated further over the following days, with Mrs X claiming the care home did not informed her about him ""gasping for air"" on June 29.

Mr Y passed away on the morning of July 1, 2020, an hour after a member of staff noticed he had ""shallow breathing"".
Mrs X complained to the care home manager, arguing staff should have noticed his declining state earlier and reassessed his needs more quickly.
She subsequently complained to Somerset Care's head office, alleging that Mr Y's care records were ""inaccurate"".
While the company did accept there had been ""poor communication"" with Mrs X and apologised for this, they did not accept her claims about the quality of care Mr Y had received - resulting in Mrs X bringing her case to the ombudsman.
What did the ombudsman say?
(Image: PA)
The ombudsman ruled that there was ""no evidence that Mr Y's deterioration was discussed or communicated to his family"" between April and June.
This lack of communication, coupled with visits to the care home being restricted due to coronavirus, caused Mrs X ""significant distress and uncertainty"".
The ombudsman has Somerset Care to make a ""symbolic"" payment to Mrs X of 150 ""in recognition of the distress caused to her at a difficult time.""
However, the ombudsman agreed with the care provide that its records ""do not show evidence of poor care"", pointing to the regular GP visits and the input of district nurses.
How has Somerset Care responded?

Nicola Kelly, Somerset Cares director of care, has apologised to the resident's family and said changes had been made to its internal communication procedures to prevent this from happening again.
She said: ""We were asked by the LGSCO to investigate a complaint made by the relative of a former resident at Croft House.
""We would once again like to extend our apologies to the family of this resident for any distress caused, and thank them for taking the appropriate steps to bring their concerns to our attention.
""The complaint raised concerns about the standard of care provided to the resident, and the quality of communication between Croft House and the residents family.
""The LGSCOs independent investigation concluded that there was no evidence of poor care, and this element of the complaint was not upheld.
""We requested that the complaint regarding communication be upheld, further to acknowledging these same concerns and apologising to the complainant as part of our own internal complaints procedure.
""We recognise that communication with this residents family had fallen short of our own high standards, and once again offer our sincere apologies for this.
""We are always looking to improve our service, and have since upgraded our internal communication procedures to ensure that relatives are appropriately communicated with whenever there is any change to their loved ones condition.
We want to hear your thoughts on this story, so please log in and leave your comment below
Concluding its report, the LGSCO requested that we offer a symbolic payment to the complainant in recognition of the impact of the isolated communication failures in this case.
""This offer was accepted by the complainant and the payment has been made. The LGSCO have concluded that we have met all of its requirements and the complaint is now closed.""

101,Nurses: Staffing levels thin at Los Robles,"View Comments
View Comments
Nurses negotiating a new contract at Los Robles Hospital & Medical Center say staffing is so thin that they sometimes can't take breaks for meals or other needs.
""We even have difficulty using the bathroom,"" said Jennifer Hardy, an intensive-care nurse and a union steward.
A three-year-contract for 670 nurses represented by Service Employees International Union Local 121RN at the Thousand Oaks hospital expires Friday. Nurses say they want wording in their new agreement that would be designed to increase leverage on making sure the hospital follows state-mandated staffing minimums.
Ratios range from requiring one nurse for every two patients in the intensive-care unit to a one-to-five ratio in medical-surgical units.

County approves mitigation for Ventura clinic; neighbors say it's not enough
Los Robles is part of an HCA system that operates 174 hospitals and 119 surgery centers in the United States and the United Kingdom. A hospital spokesman reacted to nurses' claims by contending that such complaints often accompany negotiations as a way to ""provoke public sentiment.""
""Providing safe patient care is the hospital's highest priority and we believe it is staffed appropriately,"" said spokesman Adam Blackstone in a written statement, noting government regulations surround staffing and other hospital activities. ""The hospital has an excellent relationship with regulators and makes every effort to comply with its obligations under the law and, significantly, to provide patients with the safest environment possible.""
Nurses not on duty marched twice outside Los Robles on Monday carrying signs with slogans including ""Safe Staffing Saves Lives."" In interviews later, nurses said Los Robles sometimes violate state staffing minimums.
Hardy cited situations when staffing is so thin charge nurses are asked to care for specific patients in addition to their duties supervising a unit and floating to wherever more care is needed.
""We no longer have that assistance available, which puts everyone else at risk,"" said Hardy.
Katie Brister, an oncology nurse, cited a lack of support staff including certified nursing assistants and physical therapy. The staffing pressures lead to less breaks over a 12-hour shift, meaning nurses are more tired.
""Research has shown that nursing fatigue can cause medication errors,"" she said, suggesting overworked nurses can pose risks to safe care.
""If you drive when you're tired, you're at an increased risk of having a car accident,"" she said. ""Same premise.""
Blackstone said such comments are often employed during contract bargaining to paint employers in a negative light. He said the hospital has added registered nurses to provide what he called lunch relief. He also said certified nursing assistants have been hired. He did not provide numbers or dates for hires.
""There are many issues being discussed by the parties at the bargaining table,"" he said, noting that the union delivered its compensation proposal on Sept. 7. ""The hospital is working hard in hopes of obtaining a contract that supports safe patient care and is fair to all parties.""
A union spokeswoman declined to specify wage proposals, saying they haven't been discussed in bargaining sessions with the hospital. She said staffing issues are the nurses' number one concern.
Nurses said they want the hospital to pledge to maintaining agreed-upon staffing levels in the contract, saying the state doesn't have enough resources to adequately enforce its mandated ratios. They also want contract provisions that set staffing limits for certified nursing assistants, secretaries, housekeepers and other staff.
""They're not asking to be the regulator,"" said union spokeswoman Aimee Baror. ""They're asking the hospital to agree to mutual language in the contract that would improve staffing.""
Blackstone didn't respond specifically to questions about including staffing limits in the contract. He said the union is seeking changes that could affect the delicate balance between the needs of the hospital, the employees and the patients.
""The union has sought to completely renegotiate certain articles in the collective bargaining agreement for the benefit of the union,"" he said, adding some provisions allow for what he called ""disruption of labor peace"" before a contract expires.
Both sides said their main concern is the patient.
""When the nurses are stretched so thin that they think they can't give the care their patients deserve at all times, then it's an issue,"" Baror said.",Nurse Staffing,other,,,,

104,Why Amazon makes you click a box to redeem coupons,"Attention holiday shoppers: Buy now before it is out of stock
New York (CNN Business)
Saving money can take a little extra effort: clipping coupons, searching for a promotional code, signing up for an email list....
But Amazon sometimes makes us check a box to save. Huh? Those orange ""coupon"" banners below the price on Amazon's online store are a head-scratcher.
Why does Amazon make us go through the extra step of clicking a box to ""save $2 when you apply this coupon?"" Why doesn't the coupon just apply automatically?
Click the coupon box to save.
The answer lies in the subtle but highly effective way Amazon and other stores use shopping psychology to influence our buying decisions.
Cart abandonment
Read More
By making us click a box, Amazon hopes to avoid the ""cart abandonment"" problem when shoppers add something to their virtual shopping cart but don't end up buying it.
That's a big challenge for online retailers. They miss out on billions of dollars of potential sales annually because of shoppers thinking twice about buying a product.
Around 70% of online shopping carts containing at least one item are eventually abandoned according to the Baymard Institute, an e-commerce consultancy based in Copenhagen.
The top reason customers walk away: They say they were just browsing and weren't ready to make a purchase, according to the firm.
So companies look for persuasion tactics to get shoppers to follow through and click the ""buy"" button.
Putting ""effort"" into online shopping
Amazon's tactic to display a coupon option, instead of just automatically showing a discounted price, gives shoppers an extra incentive to make the purchase right away, say marketing experts
Customers also want to be rewarded for the effort they put in to shop. It may not feel like much to click a box but it does make a difference.
Why every Costco product is called 'Kirkland Signature'
Amazon's coupon box puts customers in a more active and engaged role in landing a reward, making it more visceral for them, said Tamara Masters, an assistant professor of marketing at the University of Utah's David Eccles School of Business who studies shopping psychology.
By consciously seeing and clicking on the coupon box, instead of just having the coupon applied automatically, the ""reward can be expected to be felt more acutely,"" Masters said. ""You get to apply it and see the happy effects.""
That's a benefit to Amazon in the long run. When a consumer feels rewarded after exerting effort in purchasing, ""they are more willing to buy and more willing to pay more"" from a company in the future, she said.
Coupon pages
Amazon said in a statement that its coupons were easy to clip. And the coupon box is just one of the ways Amazon targets shoppers looking for bargains.
Amazon also has a standalone page on its website for coupons on select brands. If shoppers go to the page, they can clip the coupons virtually and don't have to take the extra step of checking a box.
Coupon clipping for the online shopping age.
Amazon's approach is designed to reach the shoppers who will shop exclusively based on which brands are offering coupons, which are different than products on sale, price promotions or discounts.
Having a dedicated page for coupons also helps ensure that coupon clippers will stay on Amazon's website and keep them away from using popular coupon sites like Groupon which can be redeemed at any retailer.
""Instead of letting coupon sites get the money, Amazon is capturing that for themselves,"" said Masters.
Offering coupons is an effective strategy for third-party sellers on Amazon too, according to Jason Boyce, the founder of Avenue7Media, a consultancy for sellers.
Coupons have been a more successful tactic compared to offering a straight-up discount in getting buyers to complete their purchases, he said. They also helping sellers move up in Amazon's search rankings, he said. ""Sale prices don't have the same results as coupons.""

105,Super-Earths: Long-lasting radiation shields may make for life-friendly worlds,"The laser system at the National Ignition Facility in California used to study irons properties
Damien Jemison
The melting point of iron has been measured in conditions similar to those found in the cores of super-Earths, planets with masses several times that of our world.
A molten iron core is a feature of many planets, including our own. On Earth, the molten core is responsible for generating a magnetosphere: a spherical magnetic field that shields our planet from radiation and allows life on the surface to survive. Understanding the conditions under which iron melts, or stays solid, can tell us how likely it is that other types of planet will be similarly protected with a magnetosphere, and for how long.
Richard Kraus
at the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory, California, and his colleagues used one of the worlds most energetic lasers, at the labs National Ignition Facility, to recreate the pressures found at the centre of super-Earths. They then used diffracted X-rays to work out whether iron would be solid or liquid under these conditions.

Super-Earths draw asteroids to other worlds, which may seed life
We mapped out the melting curve to nearly four times greater pressure than anyone had studied before, says Kraus. Then we were able to address the question of how much heat a liquid iron core needs to lose in order for it to fully solidify.
The melting temperatures that Kraus and his team measured suggest that planets four to six times the mass of Earth retain liquid metal cores for the longest longer than Earth will. This means these super-Earths should have very long-lasting magnetospheres.
While the measurement of pure iron under such extreme conditions is useful for understanding exoplanets and Earths own core core impurities and confounding effects caused by a planets mantle will also have an impact on the strength and duration of an exoplanets magnetosphere, according to Guillaume Morardat the University of Grenoble Alpes, France.
I think its a first step, says Morard. But to know exactly how the magnetic fields of these large planets work, there will need to be more modelling on what is going on inside the mantle of the planets.

106,FTC Reaches Settlement With Flo Health Over Fertility-Tracking App,"John.McKinnon@wsj.com
Updated Jan. 14, 2021 7:25 pm ET
WASHINGTONThe Federal Trade Commission reached a settlement with Flo Health Inc., the developer of a widely used period and fertility-tracking app, over allegations that it improperly shared personal data with  Facebook  and others, including whether users were ovulating.
The data shared by Flo Health often allowed online ads to be targeted to those users despite Flo Healths promises that the information would be kept private, The Wall Street Journal found in a 2019 article.
The FTCs vote on the proposed settlement was 5-0, the agency said Wednesday. The proposed settlement with the FTC, if it becomes final following public comment, would require Flo Health to obtain an independent review of its privacy practices and get users consent before sharing their health information, the agency said. The company also must notify consumers of the FTC charges that it shared consumers personal information without their consent, commissioners said.
In a statement, a Flo spokesperson said the company cooperated with the FTC, adding, We are committed to ensuring that the privacy of our users personal health data is absolutely paramount.
The company emphasized that it didnt share users names, addresses or birthdays, and that its agreement with the FTC wasnt an admission of wrongdoing but allowed it to avoid the time and expense of litigation and...decisively put this matter behind us.

His abilities, speed, and mobility make him the appropriate legend to aggressively engage and escape a fight in a fast fashion.Recently, a trick was discovered involving Octane's Stim that significantly increased the accuracy of weapons. Players were able to land more headshots than normal, steadily increasing the legend's popularity even further. This trick was discovered by an Apex content creator on YouTube named ""The Gaming Merchant.""New Octane Stim trick increases weapon accuracy in Apex Legends Season 12A new trick was recently discovered for one of the most picked legends in the game at the time: Octane. This trick involves the usage of his tactical ability ""Stim."" Upon activating it under specific scenarios, it improves the precision of weapons, resulting in faster and more accurate takedowns of opponents.Octane Mains must have had their eyes sparkling after coming across this trick and should have tried to implement it at least once in their matches.How to use Octane's Stim to increase weapon accuracy in Apex Legends?Using this trick is pretty simple. Players must use a magnified scope like 2x or 3x to perform the trick.Here are the steps to do the same:Select Octane while the character selection screen comes before getting into the air shipGet a weapon that supports a magnified scope like 2x or 3x (for example, R301, Flatline, Triple Take)Get a magnified scope, mostly 2x or higherAim down sight or ADS with the same weapon using the scope and use the stim at the same timePlayers will see that the camera has zoomed in slightly, improving the aim and visibility of the opponent playerThis trick is essentially useful in scenarios like sniping or assaulting an enemy down via medium-range combat. The aim becomes steadier and gives the player an advantage over the player on the opposite end of the weapon.However, it must be remembered that the character's health will keep on depleting upon using the stim, making him vulnerable to flank attacks.Will players get banned if they use the trick in matches?As of yet, no. To be honest, players are not breaking any rules of Apex Legends by using any sort of unfair means. If the video mentioned above is looked at closely, players can see that Octane's health is getting depleted upon using the stim.At first, it can be assumed that aiming while using the stim ability might make shooting apprehensive. However, that is not the case. Using the stim helps to zoom in further, calming the character's nerves and making the aim steadier than normal.Ever since Defiance dropped for Apex Legends, multiple changes have arrived in the game. This includes all the map updates, character balances, new game modes, and some unintentional changes.Due to these unintended changes, several aspects of the game have not been performing the way they are supposed to. This led to players facing difficulties in matches resulting in gameplay getting ruined.Apex Legends Mobile@PlayApexMobileGet ready to be legendary with Apex Legends Mobile. New events.

108,Is increased panting cause for alarm?,"By Dr. John De Jong| Ask the Vet
March 27, 2022 at 12:36 a.m.
My 10-year-old Lab has recently started to pant a lot on and off during the nights. He never seemed to do that previously. It does not seem to happen much during the day, but the night panting keeps me awake and gets me worried. What might be the causes for him doing this? Is this something that I need to be concerned with and have him physically seen soon? He is otherwise in very good shape, eats and drinks normally, gets regular walks, and has had no problems with going to the bathroom. He is up-to-date with shots and is due for an annual checkup this summer.
Dogs can pant for a lot of reasons and there may be nothing going on or a reason for concern. My own Lab used to pant or breathe more rapidly at night when he was older and there was nothing wrong with him.
The primary reason why dogs pant is for thermoregulation. They pant to keep cool since they do not have sweat glands and the panting allows for air transference which, in turn, cools down the airways and thereby the entire body. Dogs pant more when they exercise and need to cool down and short-faced dogs pant more due to respiratory capability being somewhat compromised based on their facial structure. Exercise leads to panting and overexertion or heatstroke will cause heavier and longer-lasting panting as well as other signs.
Is it possible that your dog is getting warm at night from household heating? Remember that panting is normal for dogs to do. If there is a change in pattern like you have noticed, there are other possible causes that can cause a dog to pant more often or more heavily and I will list some of them here.
Dogs in pain or discomfort pant more frequently. Stress and anxiety also can cause a dog to pant more, as can excitement. Dogs that have a fever pant to try and cool down and certain medications can also cause them to pant, as can an allergic reaction. There are certain health conditions that can also cause more panting such as Cushings, laryngeal paralysis, obstructive respiratory conditions, anemia and heart or cardiovascular disease.
From what you describe, I think you can safely wait until your dogs annual visit for a thorough examination but do not hesitate to have the dog seen if the panting increases more or you have any concerns. You can always try and video the panting and send your veterinarian a visual on which they can offer an opinion. Good luck with everything.

109,Pivot Point Consulting Issues 2022 Healthcare IT Directions Report Featuring Important Trends in Healthcare,"approximately 20% of hospitals and health clinics are currently using RPM and 43% say they believe that RPM adoption will be on par with in
-
patient monitoring in five years.
Analysis
: When determining 2022 virtual care investments, health IT leaders must understand the broad scope of potential services and technologies, patient demand for various types of services, differences in patient populations, and access enablers (as well as limiters).
Takeaway
: To establish strongholds in the virtual care space, healthcare organizations should market services to a broader geographic footprint, investment in solutions to further unify virtual care and embed it into delivery models, integrate and visualize telehealth and RPM data, build a
dedicated RPM program, and reduce the barriers to care.
Transforming Public Health Infrastructure
COVID-19 has shifted how we perceive and receive care, increased staff burnout, made remote work a possibility for millions and fostered rapid, broad innovation in solutions and services. The pandemic also sheds light on the nation's fragile public health infrastructure and is helping secure much-needed funding and transformation.
Analysis:
The evolving Build Back Better Act allocates significant funds for public health to expand the country's social safety, with significant funds directed towards public health.
Takeaway:
The impact of investment and transformation of our Public Health System will be pervasive from increasing and easing data access and reporting to shifts in career opportunities across the private and public sectors.
The Retail Health Revolution
It started in 2016-17 with Walgreens and CVS deploying Epic to thousands of care sites. Amazon took center stage in 2020-21 with bold moves in telemedicine and patient wearables, along with plans for rapid expansion of physical clinics across major metro areas. In
September 2021
, Walmart announced it would deploy Epic to 4,000 sites by 2029.
Analysis:
The deployment of EHRs in retail sites and increasing accessibility to and interoperability of data will continue to fuel the retail revolution at a pace that will compromise traditional healthcare providers as strongholds in many communities.
Takeaway:
Organizations should double down digital strategy and services and offer a frictionless end-to-end patient experience that will be a differentiator and competitive advantage over the convenience of retail healthcare.

Care leavers make up a quarter of prison and homeless populations in this country (Stock)
In the past week, we have heard sombre stories about the state of childrens social care in the UK. The Department for Education revealed that the number of looked-after childrenhas hit its highest number yet up 1 per cent from 2020 to 80,850 and the County Councils Network has predicted that this number will hit 100,000 by 2025 We must urgently address the national epidemic of inequality which has been growing silently in the dark.
Despite children in caremaking up less than 1 per cent of the population, the latest statistics from an independent government reviewreleased this year showed that care leavers make up a quarter of prisonand homeless populations in this country. This is staggering and is a stark reminder of our nations failure to our societys most vulnerable. But where are we failing them?
I believe that this issue is rooted in two areas: a lack of protection and a dangerously out-of-date attitude perpetuated from the top down.
To address the first issue, children in care are highly vulnerable to exploitation by criminal gangs. Gangs know that these children, who have already suffered trauma and been uprooted from stability, will be searching for a sense of belonging and, quite simply, frightened. These gangs do their research. They wait around care homes, schools and shopping centres to make their move. Starting with small, easy tasks for big rewards, children in care are slowly drawn into their web until they feel unable to leave. Before they are even out of the care system, theyve already been groomed into a life of crime.
The second issue which perpetuates the first is difficult to quantify, but is nevertheless to blame, and that is the governments attitude towards children in care. As outlined in a recent report by childrens rights campaigners at Serenity Welfare looked-after children and young people are viewed and treated as problems to be dealt with, rather than human beings with just as much potential as anyone else. Cuts to services intended to stop children in care from spiralling into dangerous life choices are a clear indicator that the government does not see them as worth saving. They are written off, with no encouragement or the necessary support systems in place to allow them to achieve, and left to fall into a life of crime.
Story continues
One example of this is in the shocking scandal of innocent children in care as young as nine being handcuffed whilst being transported between care settings. These are children that have not been accused of a crime and yet are deemed potentially problematic, for example because of a history of self-harm. Is it any wonder children in care enter a life of crime when they are treated like criminals from the start?
The care-system-to-prison pipeline shows our abject failure towards looked-after children. We must ensure that we are not only preventing harms and abuses while children are in care, but that they are given a support system for them to thrive. I firmly believe that mentoring for young people in care should be far more widespread and accepted as a legitimate form of support. With a dedicated, trained point of contact whose sole aim is to grow our childrens emotional and holistic wellbeing, we could divert more care leavers from prison and the streets towards higher education and employment.
The current childrens social carereview must focus on not only improving young peoples time spent in the system, but also on levelling out the playing field of their future outside it.
We are living in a Britain where these disproportionalities are only going to grow wider until we take action and take looked-after childrens futures seriously.

Carmel Medical Center
 Haifa, Israel.
Rouen University Hospital
 Rouen, France is also planning to start using the innovation. Several healthcare providers have already successfully diagnosed their first patients using Lung Suite, which works in combination with the companys Image Guided Therapy System  Azurion.
Lung cancer is the number one cause of cancer death worldwide, claiming the lives of 1.8 million people per year [1]. More than 60% of lung cancer patients are diagnosed at a late stage, reducing their odds of survival [2]. Philips Lung Suite is a revolutionary 3D real-time imaging platform that addresses the need for earlier precision diagnosis and minimally-invasive treatment with an all-in-one platform that enables doctors to perform biopsy, ablation, marking of lesions, and/or thoracic surgery procedures in the same room, allowing patients to be both diagnosed and treated. Its ability to locate and characterize small-sized lesions could significantly enhance future lung cancer care.
Story continues
Philips Lung Suite has been shown to increase the accuracy of lung cancer biopsy procedures, improving results for patients and offering the potential to immediately treat early-stage lung cancer patients, said Karim Boussebaa, General Manager, Image Guided Therapy Systems at Philips. These new partners add to our rapidly expanding global ecosystem of clinical partners who are pushing innovation forward, with of the goal of offering patients diagnosis and minimally-invasive treatment in a single procedure, improving patient outcomes and their quality of life.
No nodule can hide
Philips Lung Suite provides advanced real-time 3D imaging with augmented fluoroscopy on the companys Image Guided Therapy Systems  such as Azurion, combined with dedicated software. With Philips Cone Beam CT imaging, the X-ray detector rotates around the patient to generate a CT-like image in around five seconds, providing clinicians with a high-resolution 3D view of the target lesion and other anatomical structures. This allows the clinician performing the biopsy procedure to be continually guided by high-quality real-time imaging to advance a catheter towards the lesion through a bronchoscope. Once done, its position can be confirmed in real-time using the same imaging modality, and a biopsy sample can be taken.
In the fast-growing world of intraoperative imaging, cone-beam CT remains the gold standard for augmented fluoroscopy and lesion confirmation. Using Lung Suite, no nodule can hide, regardless of anatomical position or radiologic characteristic, making it a valuable tool for both diagnosis and future ablation procedures, said Dr. Amir Abramovich, MD., Director of Interventional Pulmonology at the Carmel Medical Center in Haifa, Israel.
Cone-beam CT is the critical step towards targeting sub-20 mm nodules and an essential tool for the transition towards bronchoscopic microwave ablation of peripheral lung lesions, said Professor Shah Pallav, MD., consultant respiratory physician at Royal Brompton Hospital in London, UK.
The advanced cone beam CT imaging combined with augmented fluoroscopy of Philips Lung Suite gives us the confidence to safely reach and biopsy difficult-to-access peripheral lung nodules, said Maarten Criel, MD., Pulmonologist at ZOL Genk Medical Center, Belgium.
Dr. Kelvin Lau, consultant and lead thoracic surgeon at St Bartholomews Hospital, London, successfully diagnosed and treated lung cancer patients using cone beam CT for biopsy, bronchoscopic microwave ablation and for precision image-guided surgery, all in one procedure, during initial clinical trial. Advanced imaging with Philips Lung suite is used during procedures for real-time 3D image guidance and confirmation. Additional clinical trials at various hospitals are expected to start soon.
An October 2021 paper
in the Journal of Bronchology & Interventional Pulmonology authored by researchers at Radboud University Medical Center, the Netherlands, demonstrated the diagnostic potential of Lung Suite. The researchers were able to raise the diagnostic accuracy of navigation bronchoscopy from 72% to 90%. In addition, the average total effective radiation dose per procedure was reduced by more than half [3].

Sitting at an office deskall day can have negative effects on your health especially if youre using an old and uncomfortable office chair For this reason, many people have turned to standing deskswhich allow you to easily adjust your desk from a seated position to a standing one with the touch of a button if theyre electric or with the pull of a lever if youre using a manual standing desk.
While a standing desk gives you more flexibility throughout your workday, the Mobile Think Desk from Juniper Office also includes casters. With wheels at the base of your desk, you can roll it around a large office or easily reposition your home workspace without having to ask a friend to help you move it.
Today well be taking a closer look at the design, build quality, assembly process, features and usability of the Mobile Think Desk to help you decide if its the right upgrade for your work from homesetup or even to outfit an entire office so that all of your employees can take advantage of the health benefits offered by using a standing desk.
Pricing and availability
Juniper sells two versions of this electric standing desk on its site with the first being the
Think Desk
which starts at $644 and the second being the
Mobile Think Desk
starting at $859.
Regardless of which Think Desk you choose, there are a number of size configurations available starting at 24in wide x 48in long and going all the way up to 30in by 72in. When it comes to the surface finish you can pick between a dark brown shadow elm, electric white, sonic maple and white oak while the legs and frame are available in black, grey and white.
Juniper also sells an optional desktop power module for $78 to add outlets to the top of the Think Desk as well as a cable tray for $84 and a personal storage drawer for $141 which both mount under the desk.
Its worth noting that Juniper offers bulk discounts for businesses looking to furnish multiple offices or locations but you will need to contact the company directly for a quote. From its site, we can see that a number of large businesses including PepsiCo, GameStop and RE/MAX as well as government and non-profit organizations such as the YMCA, the US Department of Agriculture and the US Department of Veterans Affairs have all turned to Juniper to outfit their offices.

Design
The Juniper Mobile Think Desk features a 1in thick desktop made of thermo-fused melamine with a 3mm thick PVC edgeband to protect the edges of the desk during day to day use. There are also two 2in diameter grommets on either side of the desk which allow you to discreetly run cables. While the Mobile Think Desk has a maximum load capacity of 152lbs (68.9kg), the Think Desk has a load capacity of 220lbs (99.7kg).
(Image credit: Future)
A control panel on the right underside of the desk allows you to lower the desk to 31.5in or raise it to a maximum height of 49in. There are four preset buttons available that allow you to store your preferred sitting and standing heights. The control panel also features touch capacitive buttons that vibrate when pressed.
A metal frame runs across the rear underside of the desk and holds the control box as well as the L-shaped legs on either side. Both legs have their own motors which plug into the control box and when in operation, the desks noise level stays under 58 dB.
(Image credit: Future)
Unlike the Think Desk, the Mobile Think Desk includes four large 3in locking casters. The casters attach to the legs using four bolts and add an extra 3.4in to the desks overall height.
(Image credit: Future)
Juniper also sells an optional cable tray that secures to the rear of the desk and has a minimum width of 25in and a maximum width of 42in.
(Image credit: Future)
However, while the tray is long enough to hold multiple power strips, its only 2.96in in height which means that you will have to install them vertically instead of horizontally. It may also be difficult to store a monitors power brick due to these size limitations.
(Image credit: Future)
Setup
The Mobile Think Desk sent to TechRadar Pro for review arrived in four boxes. While the desktop, cable management tray and casters were all in separate boxes, the frame and two legs came packed together in one with plastic strapping around the box to protect it during shipping.
(Image credit: Future)
While Juniper includes two Allen wrenches along with the bolts and screws needed to put the desk together, you will also need a power drill to attach the desktop to the frame as this is a commercial product.
(Image credit: Future)
Assembling the Mobile Think Desk begins with inserting the two legs into the frame and attaching the two side pieces at either end using the provided bolts.
(Image credit: Future)
From here, you need to attach the frame to the desktop using a total of 21 wood screws. As some of these screws are quite close to the frame, we recommend using an extra long drill bit as a regular one will have a difficult time reaching them.
(Image credit: Future)
Once the desktop is attached to the frame, you then need to attach the feet to each leg using four bolts. If you opted for the Mobile Think Desk, it is at this stage that you would put two casters on each of the feet.
(Image credit: Future)
The final step of assembling the desk involves securing the control unit to the front edge of the desk. Here youll also need to connect it to the control box and tidy up all of the wires connecting the two legs.
Overall, putting together the Juniper Mobile Think Desk was a fairly straightforward process. However, securing the frame to the desktop took a bit longer than usual due to the large number of wood screws that needed to be installed.
(Image credit: Future)
In use
After we finished assembling the Juniper Think Mobile Desk, we first tested it out using a small form factor PC an ultrawide monitorfrom LG, a mechanical keyboard and the MX Ergomouse from Logitech. The desk provided plenty of room for all of our devices and the grommets on either side made it simple to neatly run cables.
We were also able to easily program our preferred sitting and standing positions using the control panel mounted to the right underside of the desk. While we initially had to touch and hold the buttons to adjust the desk to the right height, we eventually figured out how to set up one-touch operation using the control panel. In order to program the control panel to use one-touch operation, you first need to press and hold the S button for five seconds or until it flashes. From here, you release the S button and then press the 1 button for 3 seconds until the screen displays H-O (Constant-Touch) or H-1 (One-Touch). You then use the up or down buttons to toggle",Juniper Health,other,,,,
116,Northstar's Stender Strinden excited about an opportunity after getting taken in USHL draft,"May 19th 2020 - 6pm.
Northstar Knights forward Ben Strinden of Fargo, N.D. is a sixth-round pick in the 2020 United States Hockey League Draft. Strinden, along with Northstar Christian Academy defenseman and Alexandria native Jakob Stender, were the first two USHL draft picks in program history. (Eric Morken / Echo Press)
ALEXANDRIA, Minn. The United States Hockey League is one of the top junior leagues in North America, and two Northstar Christian Academy hockey players are getting a shot to make a roster.
Forward Ben Strinden was playing video games in his hometown of Fargo with his friends when his mom told him that the Muskegon Lumberjacks in Michigan took him in the sixth round of the USHL Draft. Strinden is the first NCA hockey player selected in the programs two-year history.
I was trying not to worry about it too much, Strinden said. My mom called up to me and said, Ben, youre going to Muskegon. It was kind of a surprise, but Im honored to be the first one picked from Northstar, and Im excited to get to work.
One of the friends Strinden was gaming with was the next Knight drafted. Alexandrias own Jakob Stender went off the board in the 14th round to the Fargo Force.
Jakob Stender

watch live
It was an exciting day for me, Stender said. It was a long wait, but once I saw my name on the list, it was a relief. I thought to myself, Its go time. Their coach called me the next day and told me to get ready for main camp.
Even though Stender and Strinden got drafted, the hard part is yet to come. Following the draft, all selected players go to their teams main camp tryout, where they battle it out with other aspiring players. The amount of open spots on the team depends on how many people left the program the year before.
Right now, Im really fortunate that I get to skate three or four times a week up here in Fargo, Strinden said. Im working on building muscle because wherever I go next, its going to be faster and more physical. Ive already gained about 10 pounds of muscle in quarantine. Overall, Im just trying to get better heading into camp in a couple of months.
While Strinden can find ice time, the same luxuries werent available for all prospects. Because of the shutdown, Stenders ice time the last two months was limited. Now that the shutdown is over, Stender is looking forward to lacing up the skates again.
The ice should be ready to use on May 18 at Northstar, Stender said. I know I have to work my tail off if I want to earn a spot. I need to take these next couple of months to train hard and, hopefully, take a step above everyone else. I want to play hard, smart and physical, and hope that the coaches like what they see.
Stenders switch
When Stender played his first game for the Knights two seasons ago, he was a forward. By the time he left, he successfully made the switch to defense.
By no means was it an easy transition, he said. I had a little bit of defense in my background from when I was growing up, but it was a challenge. I remember that first weekend, I played defense and I was not really sure what I was doing. Honestly, the first month was like that.
After adjusting to his new role, he showed the coaching staff how versatile he is on both ends of the ice.
I learned a lot of things from our coaches, Stender said. One of the things they told me that stuck was you dont have to skate backward all the time. It sounds simple, but it clicked for me. I figured out how to take stuff from the offensive part of my game and use it when I play defense. I wouldnt be close to where I am today without my coaches.
Even after he made the switch, Stender wasnt sure about the future.
Throughout the whole season, I was always second-guessing myself. I kept wondering if I was still a forward, Stender said. I got the opportunity to move back to forward for a game this year when we had some kids sick or hurt. I tell you what, that was when I knew for sure that I was a defenseman.
Good teammates, better friends
Both Strinden and Stender are forgoing their senior years of eligibility at Northstar for junior hockey.
If they dont make their respective USHL teams, both of them have tenders to fall back on in the North American Hockey League. Strinden agreed to terms with the Minot Minotauros, while Stenders option is to go to Aberdeen and play for the Wings.
Both of them know what the landscape is like at a main camp. While this is their first time attending as draftees, they have skated with other players as undrafted prospects in years past.
Ive been to Fargos the last couple of summers, Strinden said. I know what to expect, but the mindset is a little different this year since Im trying to make the team. When I went to main camps in the past, I never had the mindset to make it. I was already planning on going back to Northstar. Even at these main camps, theres a lot of colleges there looking at us too, so its going to be exciting.
Stender doesnt just think of Strinden as a good hockey player, but as a great friend. Hes confident that Strinden will turn some heads in the coming months.
Hes one of my best friends, Stender said. Hes one of the hardest workers Ive ever met in my life, and one of the nicest kids Ive ever met. I was proud to call him one of my captains. As a player, he uses his body well and his shot is crazy. I always know I can count on him as a teammate and a friend.
For Strinden, the feeling is mutual.
Stendy is a great kid, and I love him to death, Strinden said. Hes always smiling, and it really helped to have him in practice. He pushed me, and it got competitive sometimes, but thats how you get better. Im excited to see what he can do in his hockey career.

119,SHIFT: Is five days really enough time to grieve?,"7 minute read
How can anyone be expected to pick up the pieces of their life, and that of three little ones in five days? GETTY
Article content
Its like some people have so much bad stuff, they dont know what to do with it all. They cant get the time to take care of themselves and then they end up just covering up.
This from the nurse drawing blood for a recent six-month check up at Torontos Princess Margaret Cancer Centre.
She still remembers me from the first time I had my blood taken, just days after finding out I had leukemia. Not having anyone to look after my kids, I had brought them with me. My daughter, with red bouncy curls, bright blue eyes and a fast giggle, was three; my son, with a dimply smile and adorable squishy hands one clutching a soft book about dump trucks, the other a blue container of Cheerios was one. They both sat on my knee, intently watching my blood slowly fill plastic tubes with different coloured covers that day, there were 22.
The nurse had told me my kids were my good luck.
She has seen a lot in her time at the hospital. She once told me that she feels like crying every time she sees patients alive and well years after a cancer diagnosis.
There is so much loss
She was catching me up on the state of things in the lab: too many patients, everyone is tired, and lagging supplies of syringes and blood collection tubes are stressing the staff, she said. Plus, there is so much loss. She was referring to the stories she kept hearing from patients about what it was like to lose loved ones during a pandemic. Her bright brown eyes clouded for a moment, as she looked at me over the thick red frames of her glasses, untying the yellow tourniquet from my arm. People arent taking the time they need to heal.
It made me think of a friend who recently lost her husband to cancer it felt fast to me, I cant imagine how quick it must have seemed to her and her three children. But now, for her, every day is molasses-slow, every minute filled with grief and sadness as she searches for some sense of normalcy.
She needs time time to process that now-empty space in her bed; time to hold her kids and absorb their pain; time to figure out what life moving forward looks like.
And its going to take more than the five paid days her workplace allows.
After all, recovery isnt like a load of laundry that you squeeze into the spare minutes between Zoom meetings and deadlines its a deep, all-encompassing, soul-dissolving task. Add in all of the logistics around loss informing family and friends, arranging the funeral, emptying closets and well, youve got yourself a gigantic-sized, heart-breaking hurdle to get over, and who knows how long its going to take.
A week to recover from grief sounds bananas to me
Some corporations, like where my friend works, have decided that a week is about right sounds bananas to me. After all, how can anyone be expected to pick up the pieces of their life, and that of three little ones in five days? Still, her companys bereavement policy is actually better than the usual two or three that most employees who have suffered a significant loss get across Canada.
With the exception of Nunavut, all provinces and territories have employment legislation policies that include some version of a bereavement policy,
according to Benefits Canada magazine
. Still, these arent necessarily policies that scream compassion and empathy: some depend on when and where the funeral is, with most leaves ranging from three to seven days 104 weeks in the case of the death of a child in the Yukon and Quebec. All are unpaid, with the exception of Quebec, which gives workers a maximum of five unpaid days off, including two paid days for the death of an immediate family member, while PEI offers employees one paid day and up to two unpaid days.

120,juniper berries,"Drought Tolerant Plants: TheJunipers
When I first developed a real interest in plants, I was in the heyday of my zine writing career. As my interest in gardening grew, writing a zine about it became inevitable. Initially I envisioned the zine as a journal of sorts the journal of a budding horticulturist (pun intentional). Since I was new to gardening and plants in general the zine was meant to follow my journey as I explored this new world.
A zine needs a name though, so what would I call it? It didnt take long for me to land on, The Juniper. I was familiar with a common disdain for the unsightly, overgrown, neglected, evergreen shrub full of spiders and cobwebs that for whatever reason was at one point planted right outside just about every house in America (a fire hazard, by the way). I was aware that many people were resorting to tearing them out, cursing as they battled the pokey, dirty, half dead things.
That was basically all I knew about junipers they were common landscape plants that were just as commonly despised. My affection for freaks, geeks, outsiders, and rejects led me to name my zine after a shrub that everyone hated. I guess I just felt like we had something in common, and that despite being the bane of peoples existence, it deserved some recognition.
And it does. Junipers are an important species in their natural habitats. In some areas they are dominant features to the point where entire plant communities are named after them. Consider the pinon-juniper woodlandsof western North America prominent steppe habitats that occur throughout high desert regions and support diverse forms of wildlife unique to this part of the world. Dan Johnson writes in the book, Steppes the pinon-juniper zone dominates huge expanses of the West in varying stages of health, providing a wealth of habitats and resources to the wildlife and the people who call it home.
Johnson goes on to describe some of these habitats:
In the Colorado Plateau this zone is dominated by Pinus edulis and Juniperus osteosperma, with J. scopulorum occupying drainages with more moisture. In the Great Basin, P. edulis is replaced by P. monophylla as the dominant pinon pine, still mixing with J. osteosperma, yet as one moves west, this juniper is increasingly replaced by J. occidentalis. Move farther north, and J. occidentalis dominates completely, with neither pinon pine making an appearance.
The genus Juniperus is in the cypress family (Cupressaceae) and includes up to 67 species, at least 13 of which are native to North America. They are long-lived plants that range from prostrate, sprawling groundcovers to expansive, bushy shrubs to tall, narrow trees. Their foliage is evergreen and can be either needle-like or scale-like. Most juniper species have needle-like foliage in their seedling and juvenile stages and then scale-like foliage at maturity. Some species, like J. communis, never develop scale-like foliage. Junipers are gymnosperms, so their reproductive structures are housed in cones. However, their cones are fleshy and so are commonly (and mistakenly) referred to as berries or fruits. Juniper cones are most often blue or gray-blue, but in some species they have a red, brown, or orange hue.
Juniperus communis (Common Juniper)
Juniperus scopulorum (Rocky Mountain Juniper)
Juniperus horizontalis (Horizontal Juniper)
In general, junipers are quite drought tolerant, particularly those species that are adapted to hot, dry climates. Again referring to pinon-juniper steppes, Johnson writes, in prolonged periods of drought, the pinon pines seem to suffer long before the junipers; whole hillsides of pine may go brown, leaving islands of olive-green juniper relatively unscathed. In the book, Shrubs of the Great Basin Hugh Mozingo attributes this drought toughness to the scale-like leaves: Because they are smaller and so closely appressed to the twigs, these scale-like leaves are a superior adaptation to the frequently very dry conditions in pinon-juniper communities. This herculean ability to survive on little water makes them a great addition to a dry garden.
But we may first have to get over our disdain for them. As this poston Chicago Botanic Gardens website puts it: Junipers have suffered from overuse and underimagination. (
This article
also examines our hatred of juniper bushes). Probably a bigger problem is that, like so many other plants used in a landscape, mature height and width often isnt taken into consideration, and rather than removing a plant when it gets too big for the site, sheers or a hedge trimmer are regularly deployed. Im not a huge fan of the sheered look. I much prefer a more natural form to the boxes and globes that are so common in commercial and residential plantings. Im even less of a fan of the misguided inclination to force a plant to fit in a space that it isnt meant to be (unless youre a bonsai artist, I guess). This treatment is what leads to exposing the ugly, brown insides of a juniper shrub an unsightly look that only makes people hate them more.
Brown insides of juniper shrub exposed after years of forcing the plant to fit in an improper site.
There are numerous commercially available cultivars of juniper species, offering a plethora of sizes, shapes, and forms as well as various colors of foliage. For small or narrow areas, select dwarf varieties or columnar forms that wont need to be kept in check, and in all cases let the plant express its authentic self, controlling the urge to sheer and shape it against its will.
As if their natural beauty and low water requirement wasnt enough, junipers are also great for supporting wildlife. Birds and other animals use them for cover and for nesting sites. The fleshy cones are edible, the shredding bark is used for nesting material, and the evergreen foliage provides much needed protection during winter months. Oh and, among many other benefitsthat junipers offer humans, their aromatic, fleshy cones have culinary value and are used to flavor gin.
I dont want to leave the impression that I am opposed to pruning and shaping shrubs. For aesthetic reasons, I think it should be done. However, my opinion is that unnatural shapes should be avoided. Sure, boxed hedge rows have their place in certain types of gardens, but my preference is towards more natural shapes. The following video by University of Illinois Extension provides a brief tutorial on how to achieve that.

121,Medifast Stock: Unique Marketing Model (NYSE:MED),"9m'21 revenues growing by 70% compared to previous year.
+28% CAGR over the last 5 years.
Dividend of 2.8% in 2021 backed by a coverage ratio of 1.97x.
Growth based on aggressive yet effective marketing strategy.
malerapaso/iStock via Getty Images
Can a company experience a 30% YoY growth in the last five periods and increase these figures further during the biggest global pandemic in modern history? It can if it's called Medifast
(NYSE:
MED
)
, a US company specialized in selling, mainly through the online channel, of health food, dietary products and weight-loss programs; the latter being specially designed by nutritionists and doctors with the aim of bringing a weight-loss benefit to customers. In addition, Medifast has created a community around its product, a very important intangible asset nowadays, as taught by big tech companies. But let's go into more detail.
A unique marketing model
Optavia is its real strength, the brand through which Medifast sells its products, driven by the so-called coaches, 90% of whom are customers or former customersof the company. They advertise products to friends, family, and acquaintances through a direct approach or via social networks. In addition, coaches provide moral and emotional support to customers, also using information and support that Optavia itself provides. These tools help to make the best use of the weight-loss programs by increasing their probability of success, benefitting both customers, who improve health and well-being and Medifast, which gains loyalty and increases its sales over time. As a confirmation of this, between 2017 and Q3 '21 Medifast's consumer repurchase rate was 77%. Moreover, coaches have an incentive contract as independent vendors and their remuneration is linked both to the number of products sold to new customers and the length of their working relationship. For this reason, they are not considered employees, with consequently fixed costs saving (77% of SG&A costs are variable).
Mare evidence lab research team
As shown in the table above, this aggressive marketing approach is the real boost to the Medifast business model, which is driving the outstanding growth in revenues. Revenues per coach have increased by 63% from Q4 2016 to Q4 2021, with the number of active coaches in 2021 being nearly five times the number in 2016. For this reason, Medifast is making specific investments to improve its supply chain to meet the ongoing and growing demand for its products, driven by the work of coaches.
Furthermore, in 2021 the company has launched an IT investment campaign, aimed at improving the efficiency of its supply chain by increasing its offer; this would enable it to benefit from scale economies, made possible by the growing demand in the target market. This project will play a fundamental role in the mid-term in further increasing the company's margins, as well as promoting faster and more sustainable growth.
Q3 '21 results and expectations
Mare evidence lab research team
The Covid-19 outbreak has undoubtedly been a major growth factor for Medifast, not only boosting the growth on the online sales channels but also changing the habits of many individuals, driving interest in a better and healthier lifestyle. According to the company itself, Medifast's target market is 95 million people in the United States alone, with a turnover of $43 billion and an expected CAGRof 5.5% between 2021 and 2028. However, Medifast is currently outperforming its target market with a CAGR of 27.9% over the last 5 years (2016 to 2021). Additionally, the company has achieved revenue growthof 71.4% in 9M '21 compared to 9M '20.
The company was able to keep its margins constant over the last five years, despite the growth in revenues and market shares, maintaining high profitability with a profit margin of around 10% and a 2020 ROE of 65.4%. Looking at the operating cash flow of the firm, it can be seen that figures have always been positive and increasing over the last five years, from $25.4 million in 2016 to $145.2 million in 2020). As the company is not capital-intensive, it presents low CAPEX expenses, resulting in an outstanding free cash flow over time compared to its fundamentals.
This constant flow of liquidity has been used by the company for different purposes:
to considerably reduce its debt, equal to $16 million as of Sept '21, 5.5% of assets
to accumulate a good amount of cash, $154 million as of Sept '21, which might be useful for potential M&A operations, as well as facing any situation of economic pressure
to distribute a dividend of 2.78% in 2020 which has quadrupled in the last 5 periods and backed with a dividend coverage ratio of 1.97x
to buy back own shares, especially in 2021 where the company bought 73.2 million own shares, equal to 3% of the market cap as of 28/12/2021
Conclusions
Based on the analysis carried out, Medifast appears to be a very solid company, generating important cash flows and characterized by a constant high growth in both turnover and market share. In addition, Medifast has some significant advantages over its competitors. Herbalife Nutrition
(NYSE:
HLF
)
, Medifast's biggest competitor, is for example characterized by much lower growth and margins than Medifast, as well as being much more indebted in relative terms.
Overall, however, the real strong point of Medifast is the marketing model and the management's vision of prioritizing long-term sustainable growth. If well managed, the latter can maximize the well-being of all stakeholders, especially shareholders, by producing greater value. Something that should be cherished by value investors.
According to analyst estimates provided by Eikon, Medifast has an expected P/E 2021 in the 15x zone and an estimated P/E 2023 of 11.5x that are clearly not justifiable considering the constant double-digit growth experienced in the last five years, the financial health, the cash generation, and the interesting and growing target market. The Company seems to be relatively cheap and a potentially great investment opportunity. Absolutely not to be let off the hook.

Geiselhofer runs both a for-profit, Dental at Your Door, that works with Medicare patients and a nonprofit, Deserving Dental, that works with underserved communities including people experiencing homelessness. (Matthew Jonas/Staff Photographer)

| UPDATED:
March 7, 2022 at 9:42 p.m.
As a man who has been experiencing homelessness, John Heishman has found it challenging to stay on top of his dental care. But on Monday, he was among those who didnt pass on a chance to have that task made much more easy.
Heishman, who has been living in Longmont for three years, was among those who took advantage of a daylong visit by Dental at Your Door and Deserving Dental to the Homeless Outreach Providing Encouragement program at Messiah Lutheran Church on Francis Street in Longmont.
Its definitely a big help to the homeless community here in the city, said John Heishman, resident of Longmont for three years, who was looking forward to getting his teeth cleaned.
Jennifer Geiselhofer, direct access registered dental hygienist, is striving to change the landscape of preventive dentistry in Colorado with her practices Dental At Your Door and Deserving Dental, a non-profit organization.
Dental At Your Door is a female-owned mobile dental care practice that aims to provide excellent care for those with mobility challenges. Dental At Your Door, which takes Medicaid, travels to homeless shelters, nursing homes, private homes, child care facilities, and more locations to practice comforting care.
Laura Denton, the shelter manager for HOPE the last three years, met Geiselhofer last year volunteering at a memory care center in Broomfield.
This is the first time theyve ever been in Longmont and at HOPE, so its super exciting, Denton said.
The two shared the same passion for helping those in need of dental care and arranged for Dental At Your Door to make a stop by the shelter.
Its very important. I always say, like the mouth, especially if you dont have really nice teeth, is very private, Denton said. Its something people hide and so being able to go in this room in the comfort of their own home per se and get their dental needs met is very important.
Geiselhofer has been working in the field for 25 years and founded Dental At Your Door after working on a patient in-clinic, whose husband was suffering from severe Alzheimers. The woman asked Geiselhofer if she could come to their house to give her husband dental care. He was unable to be taken to a traditional dentists office setting due to immobility.
She just hugged me and cried and just thought there was no way they were ever gonna be able to transport him to a dental office. How are they going to be able to do this? Geiselhofer said.
And the lightbulb went on for me and I was like, Oh my gosh this is my calling, I need to get to the people that cant get to a regular dental clinic. Whether it be because of mobility challenges with the senior population, or was it financial limitations and no transportation for our patients that are experiencing homelessness.
Years after establishing the for-profit Dental At Your Door, Geiselhofer noticed a large number of people were not coming in because they did not have Medicaid. Geiselhofer pointed out that last year the maximum amount of income that you could make to qualify for Medicaid was $17,000, disqualifying a significant number of people experiencing homelessness from receiving treatment through Dental At Your Door.
In response, Geiselhofer opened Deserving Dental in July 2019 which seeks to assist those who are living below the poverty line or experiencing homelessness through donations and grants.
We have a full-time schedule. So each day of the week, were at a different homeless shelter, Geiselhofer said.
After the initial examination, the company passes the patient along to a full-time dental office so they can have a dental home and continue with the care needed.
I dont think I wouldve got the quality and actual expertise and experience of other dental assistants than I did with her, said Shane Garzoli, after receiving care from Geiselhofer at the church Monday morning.

However, the primary point of criticism will ultimately be due to the fact that there are just two advanced classes. Bard and Sorceress are the only two advanced classes available to players if they choose to go the mage role. However, there are expectations that a new advanced class for the Mage class will be added shortly.Lost Ark tier list for Mage advanced classesGiven there are just two advanced classes belonging to Mage, players don't have much choice. However, both the choices are pretty good, and both are pretty high on the overall meta. While one advanced class is slightly better than the other, it will come down to the player's playstyle.Bard - Tier 1Supporting characters are at a strange place in Lost Ark at the time of writing. There are just two support classes, but they're the most hotly requested classes when forming parties. Bards may not be very enterprising initially, but their value goes up as players approach the end game.The Bard has a fantastic set of buffs that makes her extremely useful for any squad. Players will also be able to give teammates health buffs and shields. Bard's main limitation is the inability to do anything independently, and the Bard advanced class is relatively more useful in squads.Sorceress - Tier 2The Sorceress is one of the more recent additions, and many in the community have said that her playstyle represents that of WRPG characters. She has a decent amount of buffs and forms an excellent addition to aggressive squads due to her excellent burst radius. While the Sorceress can be turned into one of the best DPS characters with the right build, the character requires an experienced hand. She has low defense and low health, so players should know to protect her while playing.",Mage,other,,,,
126,Plans to reopen Somerset care home that closed due to 'mismanagement',"privacy notice
Plans have been revealed to reopen a Somerset care home which was forced to close two years ago due to ""mismanagement"".
A care home at Tyndale House in Yeovil run by Carlauren Holdings shut in 2019 due to ""mismanagement at the highest level"", planning documents recently submitted to South Somerset District Council reveal.
The home was closed by care provider Carlauren Group with only a week's notice after it fell into administration as a result of financial losses, resulting in many of its 26 staff members being paid late.

Closure of Tyndale House in Yeovil left elderly residents fearing for their future
Elderly residents were also left fearing for their future amid the sudden closure and Somerset County Council stepped in to find emergency accommodation for all those who were staying at the 18-room care home.
The premises on Preston Road was then briefly operated as a hotel, but it has remained empty since the start of the coronavirus pandemic.
Now, the same investors that backed the first care home venture have applied for planning permission to revert the building back to care use, but this time as supported living for residents under new management.
Tynedale House, Preston Road, Yeovil
Planning documents read: ""In 2020 a new company, trading as Tyndale Limited, comprising the previous investors in the care home who had not been involved in its management, were able to purchase the premises from the administrators.
""It is our intention to reopen the building as a home, providing care services for the occupants.
""However, we believe the occupants would be far better served if we operate it as a supported living accommodation, rather than a traditional care home.
""Each new occupant would be a tenant, with an assured tenancy agreement, protected by law, and would occupy their own, chosen room, rather than whatever the care home managers decide works best for them.
""They would pay rent to Tyndale, and would be offered the opportunity to purchase the provision of care services by Redleif Care, who would have a permanent presence in the building, delivering 24 hour personal care, very similar to that offered within a care home.
""Redleif currently operate a service delivering care within the homes of elderly local people, and they now wish to grow their business into the provision of a home specialising in the delivery of care to elderly residents within one building. They already hold a CQC certification to allow them to do this.""
The planning documents add: ""The nearest neighbours are the elderly residents of a set of houses at the end of the shared drive, known as Coverdale Court.
""We have consulted with them, and they have expressed delight that the house is going to be re-opened operating in the same capacity as previously.
""They have even asked if a previous arrangement, whereby the staff at Tyndale kept an eye on these residents and were available for routine, small personal requests for help, could be reinstated.
""We are keen to work with them, and will enter into such a conversation once we have begun to operate.""
The planning application is for a change of use from C2 (residential nursing home) to C4 (HMO supported living house).
South Somerset District Council will consider the application over the coming months.

127,North Carolina man used Game of Thrones-themed companies in $1.7 million COVID-19 relief fraud,"Resize icon
Winter is coming for this guy.
A North Carolina man was sentenced to 20 months in prison for fraudulently taking $1.7 million in Covid-19 relief loans for fake companies he created, including some which had Game of Thrones-themed names.
Tristan Bishop Pan, 40, pleaded guilty to wire fraud last August for submitting at least 14 applications for Paycheck Protection Program loans, seeking over $6.1 million.
Pan, who ran an insurance agency in the Raleigh-Durham area, ultimately received more than $1.7 million in benefits.
Pans attorney didnt immediately return a call seeking comment.
Among the companies Pan was accused of using for the applications were three with names taken right out of the script of the hit HBO series Game of Thrones White Walker, Khaleesi and The Nights Watch.
Pan formed each company in 2019 and listed their purpose as real estate or real estate acquisition ventures, according to filings with the North Carolina secretary of state.
Pan claimed the companies employed dozens of people and had tens of thousands of dollars in monthly payroll, when, in fact, they employed no one.
He similarly applied for loans for several other companies he had created, some bogus and some real. For the genuine companies, Pan was accused of significantly inflating the number of employees each company had.
In his applications, Pan was accused of submitting false documents and doctored tax filings.

128,Vermont Health Connect open enrollment will mean big savings to some,"Shares
Photo by Darko Stojanovic via Pixabay
With open enrollment for the Affordable Care Act marketplace beginning Nov. 1, thousands of Vermonters are about to begin the annual ritual of sifting through coverage options.
Its an important financial decision for consumers, particularly in Vermont, where the average health care costs
are higher than most
other states.
A temporary bump in federal subsidies could help Vermonters who buy coverage through Vermont Health Connectget better insurance for less money. Vermont Health Connect, the states insurance exchange, covers consumers who cant get coverage through their employers and dont qualify for Medicaid or Medicare. In 2021, roughly 24,500 residents enrolled.
But the number of Vermonters who benefit from the beefed-up subsidies could roughly double in 2022 because of higher subsidies through the Biden administrations American Rescue Plan Act, according to data from the Department of Vermont Health Access. A substantial chunk of them  roughly 18,000  are uninsured, the department estimates.
Consumers are likely to save an average of $186 per month but some Vermonters qualify for subsidies totaling hundreds of dollars each month, the federal Department of Health and Human Services estimates.
If youve been told you made too much money for subsidies in the past, its worth looking again this year, said Mike Fisher, chief health care advocate at Vermont Legal Aid.
The $1.9 trillion American Rescue Plan Act package also includes subsidies for people who didnt qualify in previous years.
For example, a single person making $52,000 wouldn't have qualified for assistance in 2020, but in 2022, that same consumer would get $381 a month toward premiums. Thats enough to cover roughly half the monthly cost on a mid-range Silver plan, according to Vermont Health Connects cost calculator
For some consumers, particularly those who make less money, the subsidies could cover their entire monthly health insurance payment. A single person with an annual income of $33,000, for example, could qualify for $674 in subsidies. According to the calculator, thats enough to cover a high-deductible Bronze plan in full.
Rescue Plan subsidies are in effect only for 2021 and 2022, at least for now. Democrats are pushing to extend the beefed-up subsidies as part of the $3.5 trillion budgetreconciliation bill thats winding its way through Congress. If the proposal is approved as written, it would be among the largest expansions in U.S. health care since the Affordable Care Act passed in 2010.
Vermonters who now buy coverage through the Health Connect portal are already benefiting from the subsidies on plans they chose before the Rescue Plan went into effect this year, and that will continue next year even if they dont sign up for a different plan.
But open enrollment, which runs Nov. 1 to Jan. 15, is the first opportunity for these Vermonters to change their coverage based on the enhanced subsidies, said Sara Teachout, spokesperson for BlueCross BlueShield of Vermont. The larger subsidies could help consumers upgrade their coverage at relatively little cost, she said.
Consumers who didnt qualify for subsidies in previous years should also head to the Health Connect portal to look at their options, Fisher said. According to the 2018 Vermont Household Health Insurance survey, more than three-quarters of these 18,000 uninsured Vermonters could get significant assistance.
People who dont sign up are leaving money on the table, Fisher said. And were not talking about a few dollars.  It could be as much as $1,000 a month.
The 6,500 Vermonters who bought coverage directly from insurers last year could also qualify for assistance, if they transfer their plan to Vermont Health Connect. Teachout recommends doing so as soon as possible, since subsides for this group go into effect before 2022. These consumers could choose to stay with their existing plan, and also choose to change their coverage for next year during open enrollment, she said.
Unfortunately every month that youre not directly enrolled through Health Connect, you cant apply retroactively, she added. You just forfeit the money.

Are Meghan & Harry Getting Paid For Their Netflix Show? Here's The Deal
By
Sydney N. Sweeney
April 7, 2021
What do Meghan and Harry stans have in common with Netflix lovers? Getting hyped over news of the royal pair's multi-year deal with Netflix to produce content in collaboration with Megan and Harry's Archewell Productions. First up is a docuseries called Heart of Invictus, which will follow the training journeys of wounded service personnel and veterans as they train to compete in the Invictus Games. But such a big film contract has sparked curiosity in those who follow the couple:
Are Meghan & Harry getting paid for their Netflix show?
Its understandable that people are curious, particularly because the couple is no longer financially dependent on the royal family However, its refreshing to hear that Heart of Invictus is a philanthropic project through and through. Not only is the show focused on a sporting event that uplifts marginalized individuals, but Meghan and Harry are redirecting compensation they would otherwise receive for this project to The Invictus Games Foundation, an Archewell Productions spokesperson told HuffPost. In a statement, Netflix has also confirmed this, saying the Invictus Games Foundation will receive significant funding from the show.
Meghan and Harry are known for being super-passionate about their philanthropic work and that devotion has remained consistent even after moving to the U.S. and leaving their positions as senior members of the British Monarchy.
In fact, the Invictus Games Foundation is one of the Duke and Duchess numerous charity endeavors. Harry founded the organization in 2014, and an Archewell Productions representative confirmed to HuffPost that Prince Harry will appear on camera so it should be inspiring to see the Duke first-hand support the resilient service people preparing to compete at the 2022 Invictus Games.
Archewell Productions is also an outgrowth of Megan and Harrys overall mission to inspire and uplift. Back in September 2020, Netflix officially announced theyd be partnering with the production company to create all kinds of programming. Documentaries, feature films, and even scripted shows are in store and all content will be delivered exclusively via the streaming platform. So if you already plan on marathon-watching Heart of Invictus when it finally debuts later this year, then sit tight because more Harry and Meghan content is sure to come

133,UC students answer: What are ways you take care of yourself during the pandemic?,"Students return to campus for the first day of the fall semester on Monday, August 24, 2020 at the University of Cincinnati's main campus.
Bailey Vianello | Contributor
Mental health has played a huge role during the pandemic. While in quarantine, many people found a place where their minds could be still in the outdoors, at-home workouts and so much more. Now that our state is out of lockdown and classes are continuing mostly online, students are finding new ways to take care of their mental well-being.
Third-year business student Cameron Coulter says the key to keeping his mind off the pandemic is staying busy.
""I've tried my best to stay busy, whether that's through work and chilling and watching Netflix,"" said Coulter.
Coulter says his part-time job as a pizza delivery driver has helped him get his mind off of things. ""It's very stress-relieving. While working at a restaurant can be very stress-inducing, the driving part is great. I get to drive my car all around and listen to my own music, which is really relaxing,"" said Coulter.
Ever since high school, Coulter found a great stress-reliever for him was going to a climbing gym. He started going to a new climbing gym, Climb Cincy, in October to get his mind off of the pandemic and school stress. Of course, he follows the protocol set by the gym to maintain a safe exercise.
""When I was in high school, I was taught to grind out any anger or ill thoughts through working out. I find peace, especially after physical activity,"" said Coulter.
Coulter says climbing helps get his muscles and mind moving.
""Every climb or problem is very much like a puzzle,"" said Coulter. ""So trying to figure it out is one of the best parts. Once you truly reach the top it is so rewarding, especially after you have failed so many times.""
Other students, like Grant James, a third-year pre-med student, have also found that working out has positively affected his mental health. He also says that cooking is a great stress-reliever for him too.
""I make sure to work out every day. It just makes me feel so much better about myself. It also helps my mind get a break from school and helps me look at all the positives in life,"" said James. ""Cooking also helps because I can relax and listen to music.""
He also says there is one simple thing that has been his savior this year: making his bed every morning. ""Making my bed every day has been the biggest help. It's great to do a small task in the morning to get me ready for the day, and no matter what bad things happen that day, at least I have a comfy, nice bed to sleep in,"" said James.
People everywhere are finding things to help make sure they stay sane during these crazy times. Putting mental health first this year is more critical than ever. Make sure to do at least one thing a day that gives your mind a break and makes you happy.",You Take Care,other,,,,

135,"Gundersen, Quartz helping families in need cover insurance premiums through HealthConnect","Since the HealthConnect program launched last October, Gundersen Health System and Quartz have assisted over a dozen families in covering health insurance premiums, at an average of $60 in savings each month.
Bintz
HealthConnect, a collaboration between Great Rivers United Way, Gundersen Health System and Quartz and funded by the latter two entities, was developed in early 2021 and launched around five months ago. La Crosse County families at between 100% and 150% of the Federal Poverty Level  the equivalent of $26,200 and $39,300 income a year, respectively, for a family of four  are eligible.
This is a partnership that is really meant to improve the health of our community by enabling people to have better insurance that can move them towards more preventative care, says Dr. Marilu Bintz, Gundersen chief population health officer. We know if you ignore preventive care, the health care system and the community frequently end up facing advanced disease that is not just more expensive for the patient but a much greater burden for the patient and the family  their support system  and the community.
Approximately 5% of La Crosse County residents do not have health insurance, according to U.S. Census data, and 13 families or individuals have participated in HealthConnect since its launch, with seven currently being assisted. The program covers an average of $60.56 a month towards insurance premiums, and while funded through Gundersen and Quartz, participants are able to use other health care providers, as it is tied to Healthcare Marketplace.
Learn how to support La Crosse area businesses
People who engage in this arent limited to getting their care at Gundersen, Bintz says. This wasnt about driving patients to Gundersen, its about improving the health of our community (by helping them) taking advantage of what health insurance offers us.
Participants in HealthConnect must be U.S. citizens or legal residents and purchase a Silver level insurance plan through the Marketplace, and will receive financial assistance in the form of Advanced Premium Tax Credits.
From a high level view, we certainly know patients who take advantage of preventive care incur much less cost both to them and the health care system. ... Those savings are quite clear because people are engaging in health maintenance rather than acute, sick care, Bintz says.
Support Local Journalism
{{featured_button_text}}
HealthConnect occurred independently of the pandemic, Bintz says, with work on the program starting three months before the local onset of the coronavirus, but the actual launch in October, when La Crosse County was in the midst of a coronavirus case spike, was fortuitous.
We know a lot of the tragedies of the pandemic, including job loss and thereby insurance loss or being unable to afford the premiums  the timing has actually been very good in helping to deal with the financial sacrifices that have been imposed by the pandemic, Bintz says.
La Crosse County resident Renee Hoff enrolled in HealthConnect early January following her retirement in late 2020 and has been pleased with the program. Hoff was looking for insurance via the Marketplace and was advised that, due to her income level ,she might qualify for and benefit from HealthConnect.
They were so nice and so helpful, Hoff says of contacting United Way to inquire.
On a financial level, everything helps, Hoff says, but the the sense of security  and her appreciation for the program  was even more profound.
Emotionally it was a very large impact, says Hoff. Its very important to the community that they are working together to help families. I hope more people hear about it so they can (utilize HealthConnect).

136,Artificial Intelligence has an advice to keep you happy  take care of yourself,"Artificial Intelligence has an advice to keep you happy  take care of yourself
Posted
February 21, 2020
Lets be honest to ourselves for a moment  we dont always listen to our moms. They do wish us well, but their old-fashioned ideas are not that approachable to us. We are modern people and we take our advice from Artificial Intelligence, right? But what if they offer us the same?
Taking care of yourself includes exercising, having little fun activities, favorite meals and so on. Image credit: Jaime Ramos via Wikimedia(CC BY-SA 2.0)
Your mom used to tell you  take care of yourself. But it is easier said than done. You need to meet deadlines, advance your education, start your career or business and better your future through effort. How and when can you take care of yourself, when there is so much to do? Achievement make us happy and this is what we are racing for, right?
Wrong. Artificial intelligence, employed by the scientists at the University of Waterloo, analysed more than 700,000 anonymous online journal entries written by over 67,000 users of a mobile mood-tracking application and came up with an advice  take care of yourself. Just like your mom told you to.
Whatever the goals you have in life, the biggest one of them all is and has always been to be happy. This AI system found a strong association between getting enough sleep, eating well and exercising and a good mood. Getting a haircut, going for a walk, having a manicure or doing other simple activities. It seems like people can make themselves happy by doing something themselves.
One of the more interesting aspects of this study was, of course, is artificial intelligence. Scientists created an AI model, capable of searching through the database, looking for specific keywords. These keywords, found in personal mood logs of participants, were associated with specific moods. Moods were then connected with other features of peoples days. For example, stressed was frequently associated with busy or overworked. In fact, this study might not have uncovered anything new (you already knew that taking care of yourself makes you happier), but this AI tool can be developed further into something capable of screening mental health issues in online social media posts.
Lukasz Golab, supervisor of the study, said: You may not be able to control the world around you, but you can control your lifestyle and your own good habits. And in terms of public health, it is useful to confirm conventional wisdom with real evidence to make sound, data-driven decisions.
And so, take care of yourself. When you are feeling stressed, look for something that would give you pleasure. Something that you can provide yourself. Get a haircut, meet friends, go out to eat. It will make you happier and thats all what matters.

137,"Strained EMS system hits AMR with $88,000 in fines, forgives over $125,000","Save
In August alone Blount Countys contracted ambulance service, American Medical Response (AMR), racked up an unprecedented dollar amount in fines: nearly $220,000.
According to area company leaders and Blount County officials, thats mainly due to wait times at Blount Memorial Hospital, where ambulances had to sit for hours before patients could be served.
AMR was recently struggling with staffing issues, but leaders say theyve overcome that problem to a degree. AMR recently brought on about 25 new employees since July and changed its shift structure, adapting to changing needs in the county.
COVID-19-related strains on the system mixed with an unusually high call volume recently are pushing ambulance services to the limit, according to Blount AMR Operations Manager Jonathan Rodgers who spoke to the countys EMS board Tuesday.
AMR the nations largest ambulance company contracts with Blount for EMS services. Crews are required to make it to calls in a certain amount of time 10-15 minutes above a certain percentage of calls each month 90%. If they dont meet these requirements, the company is fined.
Fines can accumulate for other reasons as well, like when the Blount system reaches whats called Level 0. That means AMR employees are so busy that there are no ambulances are available to take calls.
According to data provided to board members, AMR hit Level 0 a total of 15 separate times in August. That alone cost the company $110,000 in fines. Between Level 0 incidents and late arrival times, AMR was fined $219,500 for that month, according to records provided to the EMS board.
In July, AMR was fined $118,500. In June, it was fined $93,750, which it has paid.
The high fines are why AMR leaders came to the board Tuesday asking for another waiver of fines. This is the third time in less than 12 months that AMR has asked EMS leaders to look past the contract and waive fines. It came to them in November and then again in December 2020.
Since late 2020, AMR has accrued more than a half million dollars in fines: But because of EMS board votes, it hasnt actually paid that much.
The company has been using Gov. Bill Lees state of emergency declarations the latest was Aug. 6 this year in Executive Order No. 83 to justify their requests for fiscal grace.
We do intend and will agree to exercise best efforts to meet all compliance requirements as well as continue to provide all reporting metrics related to these response times as required, AMR Regional Director Joshua Spencer said in an Aug. 9 letter to Don Stallions, EMS board chair and Blounts Director of General Services.
Spencer called factors leading to high fine amounts the result of unusual factors beyond our reasonable control, citing COVID-19, delays at receiving facilities and reduced staff at hospitals.
All these factors combine justify another waiver, Spencer argued.
EMS board members noted Tuesday that AMR should be required to pay at least a portion of the $219,000 the company owes from August fines.
I think if we continue to exempt everything its not fair to the agencies out there using their supplies and manpower to wait until AMR gets there, EMS board member and Blount County Commissioner Ron French said. He then proposed they fine AMR $88,000 and forgive the rest of Augusts fines. French based this amount on response times more than 18 minutes during that month.
The board agreed with French and unanimously voted to only fine AMR that amount.
Next, they agreed County Mayor Ed Mitchell, BMH CEO Don Heinemann and others need to sit down and discuss what to do about staff shortages at the hospital and the ripple effect those staffing issues are having on the EMS system.
Heinemann is an EMS board member but was not present for Tuesdays meeting.
There are 11 EMS agencies mostly police and fire to which the money from fines is distributed and those agencies are struggling to keep up as well.
Alcoa Fire Chief Roger Robinson said Tuesday his crews are having to serve patients when AMR cant be there quickly. That hurts the departments ability to respond, too.
We had two incidents (in October) when our units were tied up on EMS calls, Robinson said. On the first call it was 27 minutes before AMR arrived and on the second call it was 49 minutes. Whats happening is... the other day we had four units tied up. All three stations were tied up on EMS calls. Three of those didnt have an AMR unit on-scene. That puts us down to two people to take a structure fire.
Weve got to fix the issue, Robinson emphasized.
Its not about the money ... Our job is to save lives. The system is failing. Were failing. I dont know what. But we got to fix it.
Heinemann emailed The Daily Times on Tuesday, responding to AMRs assertion that long hospital wait times are to blame for delayed ambulance response times.
While we know any disruption in the speed of care has ripple effects, Im hopeful that these issues will ease as COVID cases drop throughout the region, he emailed.
According to data provided to the EMS board, the time AMR had to wait at BMHs ER during the month of August totaled 509 hours, 22 minutes and 18 seconds.
The total for the same month in 2020 was nearly 325 hours.

140,How to Choose the Best Server Type for Your Business,"One of the most crucial parts of any business is IT. Choosing the right server type for your business can be a time-consuming and difficult process. Its important to understand what you need before you invest in a server that may not work for your needs.
Its also important to take into account how many people will be using the server and how often it will be used. If you have too few people or if they only use it once in a while, then a cheaper solution might work better than a more expensive one. Here are some things to consider when choosing the best servertype for your business.
Choose between an on-site, hosted cloud, or hosted bare metal server.
There are many different types of servers for various business needs, but they typically fall under the umbrellas of on-site, hosted cloud, or hosted bare metal servers.
On-site servers
An on-site server is fairly self-explanatory you install all of the necessary hardware on your business premises and manage it with an IT team. Its a good choice for startups where the company doesnt have much capital or budget. Businesses that need low-cost servers are likely to want to use on-site servers.
Bare metal servers
Bare metal servers are similar to on-site servers, but theyre typically hosted in a data center. You get complete customization and exclusive access to the bare metal server, so you arent sharing the hardware resources with any other customers, like you would on a cloud platform.
Pricing for bare metal servers varies by numerous factors, such as hardware you want installed, the amount of technical support you need, bandwidth usage, and other little things. But many providers like Maxihost bare metal hostingoffer usage-based billing, so you can pay as you go.
Cloud servers
Hosted cloud servers are typically offered as a service platform, whether they be SaaS (software-as-a-service), IaaS (infrastructure-as-a-service), or PaaS (platform-as-a-service). They are servers managed by a cloud company, and the software they run is usually part of the service being offered by the cloud provider.
For example, Dropbox could be simultaneously considered an IaaS and a PaaS, because it offers all the infrastructure services with additional platform features.
How to pick an appropriate pricing plan:
Establish your IT budget
Before you start looking into your options, youll need to establish your IT budget and ensure you have the means to purchase the server you need.
Although the price of server hardware has come down considerably, choosing the wrong one can cost you thousands of dollars. You also dont want to skimp on your IT budget either and regret it later.
Consulting with your companys IT team (if you have one) will be helpful in coming up with realistic evaluations for what sort of hardware would be most beneficial to your business, and whether you can allocate the funds for it.
Your IT department can help you establish a budget based on their experience and needs. If youve never been involved in the procurement of an IT system before, it can be an overwhelming task.
Evaluate your companys needs and expectations
There are two distinct types of server platforms that your business could use servers that are suited for web hosting, and servers that are suitable for storing critical data.
For web hosting, the kind of hardware youll need depends on your websites nature and content. Youll need a decent CPU for the server that is hosting your website and a good amount of RAM for storing its static content. Most business websites wont be graphically intensive, so you wont need a lot of storage space or processing power for a web server.
On the other hand, if your business needs to perform intensive data analysis or machine learning for artificial intelligence, youll require more powerful hardware
Understand what youll be receiving and what you will need to provide
Once youve established your budget, its time to do some research. Youll want to study various information sources, such as hardware and IT service providers, about your specific needs and requirements.
Before signing anything, its critical to have a solid understanding of what you will be receiving. Dont blindly sign a contract with the idea that a server is a server, and thats it. If you dont have an in-house IT team, for example, youll likely want to go with a provider that offers IT support, or consider hiring a managed IT serviceto help you with implementation.
Conclusion
Ultimately, you want to consult with people familiar with server technology and your business industry before making a final decision. There are various services and offerings on the market that may work perfectly for you, and many of these have pricing plans that are well within your budget.

ST. JOHN'S, N.L. - An international cybersecurity expert says there is reason to believe Newfoundland and Labrador's health-care IT network is still under siege.
David Masson with Darktrace, a cybersecurity firm based in the United Kingdom, says it's quite telling that Health Minister John Haggie told reporters Tuesday that those involved in the cyberattack are ""watching, literally, what we're doing.""
Masson, who works in Ottawa, said in an interview Tuesday that Haggie's comments suggest the cyberattack found to have hit the province's IT network on Oct. 30 is ongoing.
Premier Andrew Furey joined Haggie and other officials to announce that private information belonging to patients and employees had been accessed by the hackers.
Masson says the government's pointed, repeated use of the word ""accessed"" likely means they can see that file logs have been opened by a third party, but he says officials may not know much else.
Furey and other government officials are refusing to divulge the nature of the attack on the health network or whether the hackers are asking for money.

142,"For smaller orgs, EHR security is a disproportionate struggle","Published:
10 Aug 2020
EHR security is a disproportionate struggle, where the smallest of organizations tend to have the hardest fight. Unlike large organizations, smaller healthcare systems tend to lack the resourcesto implement EHRs from big-name vendors; they also often fail to perform security assessments and examine how the EHR operates, leading to the use of potentially less secure platformsor partnering with EHR vendors that engage in unethical practices, such as Practice Fusion. That independent EHR vendor came under federal investigation for manipulating its system to recommend and advertise opioids to physicians. In January, Practice Fusion was fined $145 million for accepting kickbacks from a pharmaceutical company.
Mitchell Parker
During a session at the virtual Black Hat USA 2020 event Mitchell Parker, CISO at Indiana University Health, shared steps that small healthcare organizations can take to find EHR security resources, as well as simple, inexpensive steps they can take in-house to beef up security
EHR security challenges
All healthcare organizations have to jump through the same regulatory EHR security hoops or face consequences, often in the form of financial penalties. The problem is, according to Parker, even large organizations struggle to meet basic federal requirements.
EHRs have to be certified by the U.S. government to receive federal reimbursement. Healthcare organizations are also required to complete annual risk assessments and risk management plansand follow up on what they find in terms of EHR security.
Failure to complete these tasks results in fines from the Office for Civil Rights, the enforcement arm of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services. In a study, Parker assessed
settlements issued from 2015 to 2020, many of which involved multibillion-dollar organizations. He discovered five key factors for OCR fines related to EHR security. They are as follows:
Failure to complete a risk assessment;
Failure to complete a risk management plan;
Failure to follow up on a risk assessment;
Failure to properly report breaches within 60 days; and
Failure to report a breach.
""If these multibillion-dollar companies can't do these five things, what are the odds of a smaller practice being able to do so?"" he said. ""If they're not doing these, they're also not reviewing changes to the EMR system, they're not reviewing changes to clinical decision support alerts, they're not reviewing who has access and they're not providing relevant training for purposes other than checking a box.""
That's why Parker is advocating for changes to the Stark Law and Anti-Kickback Statute safe harbor regulations These fraud and abuse laws prohibit providers from paying for referrals that receive reimbursement from the federal government or refer patients to a facility where the provider has a financial relationship. Safe harbors outline payment practices that aren't considered kickbacks or bribes to providers. In 2019, HHS proposed making the donation of cybersecurity services from larger organizations to smaller healthcare providers a safe harbor. This would mean healthcare systems could donate cybersecurity services for free to physicians who refer patients to its hospital and not face Anti-Kickback Statute penalties. Moving forward with this change will help smaller organizations achieve better EHR security, Parker said.
Improving EHR security
Smaller health systems may face a more daunting task of providing strong EHR security, but they are not alone.
Large organizations are paving the way, discovering the hurdles and working through the kinks -- something smaller organizations should use to their advantage. Parker said smaller healthcare organizations can contract with a larger healthcare system to use its EHR as well as its IT and security support teamsthat come with that -- teams smaller organizations often can't afford to employ.
""Use their expertise, use their staffing, pay them for their service to help,"" he said.
Small healthcare providers can also take steps to enhance EHR security without a larger healthcare system's help. One method is to limit who can make changes in the EHR. For those given permission, IT can require two-factor authentication, two forms of identification provided by the user before access is granted.
""I always reference Microsoft in their presentation at RSA earlier this year discussing how, out of all their account compromises, 99.9% of them occurred with people that did not have two-factor authentication,"" Parker said. ""When your sample size is a billion accounts, that's a pretty good sample size. We have to work to make sure access is secure and use two-factor authentication even with smaller practices.""

If youve been hoping to get a coronavirus vaccine soon, you could get your chance in the coming weeks as an Indiana University researcher starts enrolling volunteers in a trial of one of the United States four vaccine candidates.
IU will be the only site in the state included in the study of a compound developed by the drug company AstraZeneca in partnership with Oxford University. Researchers at 81 sites around the country hope to enroll about 30,000 people, two-thirds of whom will receive the vaccine and one-third a placebo.
The Phase III trial is the last stage before manufacturers would seek approval from the Food and Drug Administration for widespread public use.
In Indianapolis, Indiana University Health University Hospital will be looking to enroll about 1,500 people over about eight weeks, said Dr. Cynthia Brown, an associate professor of clinical medicine at the IU School of Medicine, who is overseeing the study locally.
To be eligible to participate volunteers must be over 18, healthy, not have had a confirmed case of the coronavirus, and be in an environment where they have an increased risk of contracting the virus. This category includes essential workers such as health care workers, factory workers, teachers who are back in the classroom, and bus drivers.
A few months ago, the studys sponsors contacted Brown and asked her to participate. She did some research on the vaccine and liked what she saw. Not only did it seem safe, but the people in earlier trials had a good immune response.
I felt like this was the one we wanted to put our time and effort in, she said. Were all thinking about the potential for greater good.
Earlier studies of the vaccine candidate showed that those who received it produce T cells, white blood cells that attack coronavirus-infected cells, within 14 days and antibodies to the coronavirus within 28 days.
Those who participate in this trial will receive two shots, similar to a flu shot, four weeks apart. Earlier studies suggested that this schedule produced the strongest immune response. They also will have their blood drawn three times in the first three months to determine whether they have built up protective antibodies to the virus.
Participants will be monitored to see whether they contract the virus at any point during the trial.
The Hoosiers who participate will have the chance to be a part of a study that, if successful, could help scientists turn a corner on combating this disease, said Dr. Jay L. Hess, dean of the IU School of Medicine and IUs executive vice president for university clinical affairs, in a press release.
Enrollees will not be told whether they received the vaccine or a placebo. However, typically in trials such as this, if researchers see a clear benefit, they later inform those who did not receive the actual vaccine.
Taking part does not mean one has an excuse to stop protective measures such as wearing masks, social distancing and washing hands, Brown said.",Indiana University Health,other,,,,

Researchers found that firing lasers or reflected sunlight up at the discs pushed them into the air a small distance, and that they could direct the discs by adjusting the laser light.
However, the team explains that they key to hovering is the heat created from the lasers hitting the nanotubes.
They note that some of the heat was absorbed and some was not.
The heat striking the bottom of the discs transferred heat in a way that resulted in more downward-moving molecules gaining velocity than did molecules gaining an upward velocity. The result was upward movement of the disc.
The breakthrough has gained NASA's attention as a potential technology to explore Mars - it could be used to collect temperature and composition in the Martian atmosphere.

TUESDAY, JUNE 18, 2019
If you have heard of it, you might be wondering, What is dry needling? Dry needling is quickly gaining popularity among people who have chosen a therapeutic treatment to relieve muscle pain. It also helps your body to release
and be able to move like it should.
What Is Dry Needling?
The term is used to define the need for non-injection needling, or dry. In hypodermic needles and injection, the needles are used to inject liquid chemicals or other agents, such as saline or anesthesia, into tissues of certain parts of the body.
On the other hand, dry needling treatment is carried out with the help of a needle that has a therapeutic effect when exposed to body tissues, but without the liquid. Small needles, similar to those used in acupuncture are used in this treatment.
How does dry needling work?
It is a procedure in which fine filament needles are placed in the trigger points of muscles. These trigger points are located in various muscles in the body and respond well to this stimulation. The muscles relieve muscle tension after releasing the needle, helping to reduce the pain and stimulate healing.
Dry needling
is intended to solve problems related to body posture, body disorders, and muscle damage. In combination with the best osteopathic and therapeutic procedures, a dry needle really brings many benefits, including relief from injuries and chronic pain.
It is one treatment method that may be used among others to help speed up recovery and allow your physical therapist to treat and release muscles that other forms of therapy cannot reach.",Empower Physical Therapy,other,,,,

The ball is about four inches in diameter and a little less than two pounds in weight. The weight and size of the massage ball are optimum for effective muscle trigger point release, deep tissue massage and facial stimulation.
The creators claim that the Meteor is a superior alternative to foam rollers, percussion massage tools, massage sticks, heat wraps, and other muscle recovery and pain relief devices.

The United Health Interface, which will allow the interoperability of health services like the united payments interface has done for payments, will go live this week.
Dr R S Sharma, CEO of National Health Authority, said: UHI will go live this week. We are putting UHI as a platform and inviting the entire community to contribute with their feedback. We are working on it very fast and I believe we will be as successful as UPI.

UHI is in line with UPI. UPI is a language of money transfer, similarly, UHI is a set of protocols, which is going to create a language of health service delivery, he added.
Sharma was speaking at the 16th edition of India Digital Summit 2022 organised by Internet And Mobile Association of India. Privacy and data protection was a recurrent focus of the first day of the summit which adopted the theme of Supercharging start-ups for this edition.
Privacy is not a zero sum game. It is a typical myth that to have privacy you have to sacrifice some functionalities. We have worked in a federated architecture which means we don't put the data in one place as it can become a single point of failure, said Dr Sharma.
Google India MD and IAMAI chairman Sanjay Gupta said, We have to ensure privacy and safety of people on the internet. Winning the trust of a billion Indians is going to be critical and we can't leave our doors open to bad actors and leave it to law enforcement to bring them to book.
Start-ups will play a pivotal role in achieving a trillion-dollar economy by 2025 from 250 billion dollars currently. Today, startups employ half a million people in India. That means, we need to focus on the right enablers for the growth -- regulatory framework, right infrastructure, to ensure digital economy can grow equitably. Also, we need to ensure a safer internet, he added.
UIDAI CEO Saurabh Garg said that the next leg of Aadhaar based innovations will be in areas like confidential computing, quantum computing-led cybersecurity infrastructure, faster biometric solutions and blockchain based products to make the authentication system more decentralised and secure.
The Aadhaar chief said that over 50 million Aadhaar authentications are taking place per day and over 400 million last-mile banking transactions are being done every month through Aadhaar-enabled Payment System (AePS).
He reiterated that for individual residents Aadhaar authentication is free and will always remain free. Recently, UIDAI had slashed the price for authentication to Rs 3 from Rs 20 per instance to enable entities to leverage its infrastructure for providing ease of living to people through various services and benefits.

Joshin, an app-based startup for booking caregivers for people with special needs, announced Tuesday it closed a $3 million seed round.
The funding was led by Anthemis Group and The Autism Impact Fund.
The Minneapolis-based company will use the funding to grow its network of providers and expand its corporate benefits program.
""Were continuing to scale our technology to lessen the burden of caregiving responsibilities for employees and their families, said CEO Melissa Danielsen
Joshin, which has grown its community base by 200% in the last year, is also expanding its services to Los Angeles and Seattle.
For too long, people who have special health needs and their families have been underserved and had fragmented access to disability care providers, Danielsen said.
The company's app allows families to book caregivers for those with special needs. Customers use the app to create a plan to introduce their loved one to a caregiver, including their needs, goals, likes, diet and other needs to a trained caregiver.
This care plan ensures continuity when a family schedules a care date with someone new. Caregivers are all vetted and are matched based on experience and needs of the family, the firm said.

171,Women's Health Heroes,"Women's Health Heroes - Pt 6
Monday, May 31, 2021
Dr Alfred Dawes, Medical Director, Windsor Wellness Centre.
General, Laparoscopic and weight loss surgeon
What he does:
I specialise in bariatric surgery. This involves changing the size of the stomach and rerouting the path of consumed food leading to hormonal changes, decreased calories digested and subsequent weight loss. With over a third of Jamaican women obese, bariatric surgery and other weight loss methods offered have significantly impacted the health of many who suffer from polycystic ovarian syndrome, diabetes, hypertension, sleep apnoea and importantly for many, their self confidence and depression.
What made you fall in love with the job that you do?
It was seeing how it changed my patients' lives when they lost weight and many chronic conditions improved or disappeared that saw my love for bariatric surgery grow. They literally become a new person. I never feel as rewarded even when I remove a cancer to help someone return to normal. After bariatric surgery it is a whole new normal that patients experience and I love being a part of that transformative process.
What would you say is your field's most valuable contribution to Jamaican women?
I have helped many women with fertility issues because of their weight. The birth of a child extends my work beyond the present generation.
What makes focusing on women's health important to you?
Women are the bedrock of Jamaican society. Not only do we have the most female managers per capita in the world, but women head up far more households and are tasked with taking care of families and juggling careers. We can't allow our most valuable resource to get sick!
What makes your field particularly dynamic and interesting?
Bariatric surgery is constantly involving to less invasive methods and the benefits of the procedures are updated continuously. Bariatrics is rapidly growing and is at the forefront of the surgical field. It is an interesting place to be, on the frontiers of medicine.
If you had one bit of advice for Jamaican women, what would it be?
If you see your weight climbing it is easier to stop the weight gain than trying to reverse it when your body mass index gets too high. Nip it in the bud!
What's one interesting thing that your patients probably don't know about you?
I am an avid gardener in my spare time. That's my safe space where I relax and unwind.
If you could trade this job for anything, would you?
At some point I might consider trading in the knife for the pen and become a writer, but that would be long from now.
Dr Noel James McLennon, Consultant Paediatric Surgeon & Public Health (Health Management) Consultant
What he does:
My job as a paediatric surgeon primarily caters to children with medical conditions requiring surgical operations and procedures to correct or treat them. A paediatric surgeon is a specialist who is trained to diagnose, treat, and manage the preoperative, operative, and postoperative care of the child. We care for and operate on children whose development ranges from intra uterine life to the newborn through to the teenage years. Paediatric surgeons have expertise in the following areas of responsibility: prenatal surgery (detect abnormalities and plan for surgical corrections during the foetal stage of development); neonatal surgery (specialised knowledge in the surgical repair of birth defects in the newborn); trauma (knowledge in the surgical care and prevention of traumatic injuries); paediatric surgical oncology (knowledge of the diagnosis and surgical care of children with cancers and other growths); and surgical problems of the gastrointestinal tract, such as inflammatory bowel disease, appendicitis, gastroesophageal reflux (reflux of food from the stomach to the oesophagus or trachea). Paediatric surgeons are also trained to care for certain surgical problems of the neck, skin and soft tissues, and vascular and endocrine systems.
The scope of my job is inextricably tied to mothers' well-being, comfort and reassurance, and so an important aspect of the job involves antenatal screening and counselling of pregnant women whose unborn babies have been diagnosed with congenital conditions requiring surgical intervention either during pregnancy or shortly after birth of the baby.
What made you fall in love with the job that you do?
I have always loved to work with and for children. Their pure innocence and unfettered charm and uncanny ability to bring joy to their families endears me to them. I loved the field of surgery from early medical school training at the University of the West Indies, Mona. Therefore it was a natural fit to combine the two areas of interest. I later decided to pursue studies in public health to broaden the appreciation of the context within which I practice surgery.
What would you say is your field's most valuable contribution to Jamaican women?
Surgical operations, which include electives (scheduled) and emergencies, on children in Jamaica are estimated to be over 6000 per year in the public and private sectors. The burden of surgical condition in children has a direct impact on the rates of maternal mortality and morbidity. The emotional distress placed upon mothers when their children are ill is immeasurable. Girls who present to the paediatric surgeon for a variety of gynaecological complaints are attended to and advised along with their parents. A paediatric surgeon is really the paediatric gynaecologist who treat many conditions of the reproductive system including birth defects, tumours, some abnormalities resulting from precocious puberty and breast lumps and other breast conditions.
What makes focusing on women's health important to you?
The healthier the mother, emotionally and physically, the more she will be in a position to give her child the optimum care and attention deserved. Invariably, in my weekly surgical clinic which on average numbers well over 100 patients being seen, 98 per cent of the accompanying parent is the mother of the child. Sometimes these women have to take time off from work, share time between the sick child and other healthy siblings; balancing the responsibilities of motherhood and working life.
What makes your field particularly dynamic and interesting?
The field of paediatric surgery is dynamic because of the unique and necessary arrangement between child and parent. Every child presents to the doctor with a parent(s). The child has his/personality and so does each parent. The child care specialist must understand that although there is a duty to the young patient.
If you had one bit of advice for Jamaican women, what would it be?
It's important to plan for children. Your child may get sick with minor or major illnesses; however, seek medical advice early for your child. In most cases of serious illnesses, early detection will change the course for the better. For example, a lump in the child's tummy is far more amenable to complete removal when detected earlier.

Charlie Brown
of Consumers for Dental Choice stated: ""Envista is fighting the arc of history that bends toward justice.  It needs to stop sending this inferior, toxic product increasingly relegated to consumers forced into American and Canadian federal government programs where they have no choice.""
Beatrice Olivastri
of Friends of the Earth Canada said, ""It's incredible that Envista plans to wring the last pennies of profit from mercury-containing dental amalgam when its negative health impacts are clear.  Shareholders of Envista should consider future potential liabilities from ongoing sales of a well-established toxic substance.""
Tracy Gregoire
of the Learning Disabilities Association  many of whose state associations signed onto the letter  said, ""Mercury-free alternatives are cost-effective, perform as well, and are available and used worldwide.  Envista needs to focus on selling the non-polluting and modern alternatives, which will also help protect children's brain health.""

(41NBC/WMGT) Piedmont healthcare is currently conducting a Community Health Needs Assessment (CHNA) in order to study the current needs of the communities that it serves. The healthcare company is inviting the public to weigh in on the subject by opening a survey in hopes to better understand local health challenges and identify different health trends within each community.
The assessment is intended to be a measurement of the health and general well-being of each given community doing so helps in identifying and prioritizing the unmet health needs within each area. In performing the CHNA, Piedmont will be gathering and analyzing data, listening to the feedback of the community and stakeholders, and going over Piedmonts past work in order to determine future opportunities.
This is the fourth Assessment that Piedmont has conducted since 2013, and the company says that this year it will serve as a foundation for developing their community benefit strategies.
Piedmont exists to serve its communities and the CHNA helps us to see the areas in which our resources can make a positive difference in the lives of community members who are most in need, said Piedmont Vice President of External Affairs Thomas Worthy.

182,"PCOC Spotlight: How Community Oncology Is a Low-Cost, High-Quality Provider","Having the option of receiving care in their community instead of a large hospital located hours away is not only a benefit for many patients, but research results are showing that community oncology practices are also a low-cost, high-quality provider of care, explained Jeffrey Patton, MD, executive chairman of Tennessee Oncology and CEO of OneOncology.
How will hospital price transparency impact community oncologists?
PATTON: I hope that the pricing transparency shines a bright light on what we already knew, which is to show the payers in the world that we are the low-cost, high-quality provider. Hopefully, that will allow a steerage of patients our way and really drive our businesses and help us thrive.
Since the first paper was published on January 15, [2021],1 Ive done 4 talks. My talk on [September 24, 2021, was] about hospital tr ansparency, largely talking about community oncology [and how it] is the high-quality, low-cost provider. Now we have data to prove it. An article was published about the 340B hospitals and their transparency, and theyre marking up those discounted prices as much as the other acute care hospitals.So, I hope that transparency drives payers to have better conversations with us and hopefully stops the mass exodus of community oncology to hospitals and allows physicians who want to come back and practice in the community the opportunity to do so.
What is the tole and the benefit of a community oncologist vs a big medical center?
PATTON: For me, the primary thing is that were able to deliver care at a convenient place close to where patients live, instead of in a hospital campus where its, you know, hard to park. In Tennessee, we go out to rural areas an hour outside of Nashville, and its just mom-and-pop, and were delivering care right there in the community where patients are in a very convenient location. Thats one [thing].
[Second], as independent oncologists, we own our practice, so we get to make our own rules and were very nimble, and so we can adjust to changes in both care and care patterns, and the regulatory environment.
To me, the independence of owning your own practice and providing a more convenient location for patients is a lovely combination.
Other than COVID-19, what is the biggest challenge facing community oncologists right now?
PATTON: I think its always being worried about what the governments going to do. There are unintended consequencesjust like 340B, I think, has ballooned into something it shouldnt have. And its pushed physicians toward hospitals, which is a more expensive site of service, which we now have proof of. So, I dont worry about the government doing things against us, but I worry about them doing things that have unintended consequences.
Now the cost of cancer care is exploding, and [the government] wants to do somethingI just worry that theyll do something thats not right for community oncology. And I know that patients deserve the choice of either been cared for in their communities, where they live, or going to a large hospital in a large city. That should be their choice, but I think they should have that choice. Unfortunately, the wrong law could push the world [to a place] such that we cant practice independently, which would be a shame.

April 2, 2020 at 12:43 PM EDT - Updated April 2 at 1:14 PM
ALBEMARLE COUNTY, Va. (WVIR) - Naborforce an on-demand caregiver service, normally sends assistance for people who need it for just a few hours. However, they have shut down all in-person visits because of the COVID-19 outbreak.
Now, the people who were part of the companys gig economy are trying to keep up with former clients through Kindnessgrams. They are dropping off slips of paper with options for people to check off, if they need help getting groceries or just a phone call so they dont feel lonely.
Paige Wilson, who started Naborforce two years ago, says the company made the decision to stop in-person visits early in March.
We realized that, you know, it was heartbreaking, but we had to stop in-person visits with our clients, said Wilson. We just cannot introduce them to the risk, obviously, and so, from a corporate standpoint, obviously that has a huge impact.
Robin Kaczka, who was a neighborhood lead with Naborforce, is now volunteering to help her neighbors rather than being financially compensated for her work.
Im really proud and impressed by the care and concern that all of our neighbors bring, because they not only step up and say, Yes, Im going to come in and help people, Kaczka said. I mean, Im willing to do the little bit of work and provide companionship for people who are older, or not even necessarily a whole lot older than us, but just need ... an extra hand.

Naborforce is still offering some of its services like grocery and pharmacy delivery, for a fee, for those who are not able to go out.

201,Researchers Speak Out on CRISPR Products,"June 21, 2018
--
Rarely in the scientific realm does a niche technique explode into a viable market worth billions of dollars over just a handful of years. When it does, the chaos that ensues is driven by the scrambling of life science product and service providers who vie with each other to secure market share. The market for CRISPR/Cas9 genome editing is no exception to the rule. Since its advent in the mid-2000s, the technique has continued to generate interest as more and more researchers adopt the technique. After being named the breakthrough of the year by AAAS in 2015, use of the technique has surged to unprecedented heights and it shows no indication of slowing.
At The Science Advisory Board we surveyed our members in order to gain their insight on a variety of highly pertinent topics within CRISPR/Cas9, including research objectives, experimental designs, product uses and preferences, future needs, laboratory spending, drivers of customer satisfaction, brand loyalty switching behavior, and much more.
Catalog Breadth and Customer Satisfaction
The breadth of applications for CRISPR/Cas9 has spawned an enormous catalog of products and services offered by suppliers. According to our research, the breadth of product offering is a key driver in user satisfaction, right up there with company reputation and timeliness of delivery. If there is one thing scientists want, its for their primary supplier to be a one-stop-shop for their CRISPR/Cas9 needs.
Supplier Attributes That Drive Customer Satisfaction
An example of one company that recognizes this fact is Horizon Discovery. In July, the company agreed to acquire Dharmacon from GE for $85 million. The offer consisted of $50 million in cash and $35 million in equity consideration, giving GE a 9% holding in Horizon Discovery. Dharmacon provides RNAi products, CRISPR reagents, and arrayed libraries. Through the combination of complementary technology, product portfolios, and manufacturing capabilities, the acquisition of Dharmacon by Horizon creates an emerging",The Science Advisory Board,m&a,,,,

211,ACROFAN,"Kang Mi-Hwa CEO of CONSEL is advancing Korea into the global market through the collaboration of blockchain and fortune-telling
South Korea is currently going wild about her charm.
Wednesday, November 27, 2019, 4:57 pm
ACROFAN=Jae-Yong Ryu
jaeyong.ryu@acrofan.com
Regardless of times and places, the formula for success is summarized as one answer, a relationship of credit. Not only those closest to you, but also the many people you meet through your social life, if you treat them like your family and earn their trust, you will eventually attain the ""Success"" title. Here, there is a woman who Korea pays attention to as an icon of success and sharing, a young CEO with a management mind and a bold drive for the socially underprivileged.
Kang Mi-Hwa, head of CONSEL, is this woman. With passion and determination, Kang says she will continue to grasp the needs of those she has gained trust with and analyze the trends in order to maintain that trust. As evidenced by her commitment, CONSEL is steadfastly growing. In response to this, we met with Kang Mi-Hwa, a CEO who constantly admonishes herself to keep up with the founding intention of being a good company, and shared a taste of Korean perseverance and affection as we listened to her on the secret of success and management philosophy.
(Hereinafter is the interview with Kang Mi-Hwa)

Q. Can you tell me about Kang Mi-Hwa, not as the CEO of CONSEL, but as a person?
I think I had a unique business mind since childhood. I liked trying new things and grew up with a feeling of confidence that comes from turning challenges into success. In my twenties, I started my social life and became interested in various fields, which I endeavored to become an expert. As a result, I was able to participate in various projects. Based on my experiences, I turned numerous projects into success by interacting with distinguished people from various countries. While building up know-hows during the last twenty years, my network of people has expanded to more than 30,000 from all levels of society and to some extent, I have become influential. It was during this time that I looked around again. I thought that sharing should follow after success, and I wanted to give support to those in need. Perhaps I have been silently running all this time to create a way to share hope with them. Studying fortune-telling in my twenties gave me the opportunity to meet extraordinary people from various fields, and by communicating with them, I was able to learn from them and carry on precious relationships.
Q. What are some of the sharing events that you had in the past and some that you plan to have in the future?
Donation, devotion, service, and love are the main themes of CONSEL. The greatest variable in carrying out a service project is everyone's participation. That is why success depends on how interested and involved the people are with projects. CONSEL intends to proceed with all of its activities transparently to build trust. In addition, we will endeavor to spread the donation culture to share genuine love with those in need around the world, starting with domestic donation events first.
Q. I am curious about your service philosophy.
Anyone can keep the word service in mind, but it is not easy to put it into practice. Most people, if they have time and money to spare, they will serve and help those in need. But in reality, this is not easy if you have a job or a career. So, I think that we need to create a practical culture of service so that the caring hearts of many people can be delivered as long as they wish to. For example, there are many different donation cultures around us. The problem is that some organizations don't spend all of their donations on people because they have to use donated funds for company operations. I understand that this is needed but it should be minimal so that more people can be helped. As a pioneer of the 4th Industrial Revolution, we plan to use unique blockchain technology to make a transparent donation culture. When people hear the name CONSEL, I want them to picture a trustworthy and reliable company that engages in real sharing and volunteer service. And as for my philosophy about serving others, I think I should never be content with what I am doing at the moment, but rather always look for improvement.

Q. I will cheer for you. Now, I would like to ask Kang Mi-Hwa as CEO. What is the beginning and background of CONSEL?
CONSEL Inc. is specialized in integrated business such as distribution, blockchain, software development, program development and incubating. In 2015, building on our prior experience and know-how, we started a blockchain and cryptocurrency business under the name of LACENT so that we could grow into a more specialized integrated business with the best experts in the industry. We renamed the company to CONSEL in 2019. At the time, Korea was lacking in information related to blockchain and cryptocurrency. However, we were able to keep up with the trend of the times faster than anyone else and CONSEL has been able to grow into a global business, even opening up an international cryptocurrency exchange.
Q. What is CONSELs key business plan?
In Korea, the Bitcoin craze blew in 2017, and millions of people became aware of the existence of cryptocurrency, and related businesses sprang up. Most of them jumped into the cryptocurrency market aiming to become rich, but many didn't have the needed information and market flow, so many people lost their money and many startups gave up their business. We at CONSEL are doing our best to help people and businesses by incubating blockchain startups, cryptocurrency-related software development, and program development by providing professional consulting related to blockchain and cryptocurrency. In addition, we have developed 'CONSEL', a blockchain-based matchmaking platform, and are about to launch it. We had a business launching presentation in the '2019 SEOUL conference' in October.
Q. Please explain the CONSEL platform.
People for ages have shown interest in fortune-telling and luck. Records from ancient Korean books show that as early as 600 years ago people based their marriage on fortune-telling. The words daily fortune is registered about once a week in a real-time search query on the online portal sites. In the past, there was so much interest in fortune and fortune-telling that it was said that newspapers were purchased to see fortunes. As a result, numerous fortune and fortune-telling sites have appeared overnight, but most sites only provide general comprehensive results based on stored solutions. In addition, since the profiles of the fortune-tellers were not clear, reputation issues arose with reliability concerns. Nowadays, not only are Korean people showing interest in fortune-telling as a field of study but are also spending money for fortune-telling sessions, supporting a 4 trillion won per year market.

221,Utility company files annual fixed cost adjustment,"Print
Save
BOISE Idaho Power has filed the first of two annual cost adjustments with the Idaho Public Utilities Commission, according to a news release earlier this month. This years annual Fixed Cost Adjustment requests a decrease of $4.9 million, or 0.81%, for residential and small general service customers in Idaho.
If the FCA proposal is approved as filed, a typical residential customer using 950 kilowatt-hours per month would see about a $0.81 decrease to their monthly bill beginning June 1.
However, the final impact to customer bills wont be known until a second annual adjustment, the Power Cost Adjustment, is filed in April.
In addition to the FCA filing, Idaho Power has requested a price increase to collect the cost of an accelerated depreciation schedule for all coal-related investments at the Jim Bridger Power Plant in Wyoming. Idaho Powers most recent long-range plan has concluded that ending coal-fired operations at Bridger by end of year 2028 will lower costs for our customers over the 20-year planning horizon. The Bridger filing calls for near-term revenue increase of $27.1 million, or 2.17%, to facilitate the earlier exit. If approved, all rate changes will go into effect June 1.
The FCA annually adjusts prices up or down based on actual changes in energy use per customer during the previous year. It is a true-up mechanism that separates energy sales from revenue to eliminate financial disincentives for Idaho Power to invest in demand-side management, which can contribute to use per customer declining.
In 2021, Idaho Powers energy efficiency programs saved 143,971 megawatt hours enough energy to power about 12,600 average-sized homes for a year. Idaho Power values demand-side management, energy efficiency and education programs, and the FCA mechanism allows us to provide these programs to our residential and small general service customers without negative financial impacts.
The FCA allows Idaho Power to recover an IPUC-authorized level of fixed costs costs associated with things like generation plants, power lines and substations per customer. If the company collects less than the authorized fixed-cost amount, it can collect the difference through a surcharge. If the company collects more than the authorized amount, it refunds the difference to customers through a credit.
Opportunities for public review
Idaho Powers filing is a proposal subject to public review and approval by the IPUC. Copies of the application are available to the public at the IPUC offices (11331 W. Chinden Blvd. Building 8, Suite 201-A, Boise, ID 83714), Idaho Power offices or on Idaho Powers website,",FCA,regulatory approval,,,,

226,Sanderson Farms Celebrates Women in Agriculture,"Sanderson Farms Celebrates Women in Agriculture
LAUREL, Miss.
,
March 8, 2022
/PRNewswire/ From the farm to the board room, and everywhere in between, women are thriving in all facets of the agriculture industry. As the industry is challenged to produce food more efficiently, sustainably and in increasing volume, female professionals are answering the call across the nation.
To coincide with International Womens Day on
March 8
, Sanderson Farms will celebrate the women who make up a vital part of its workforce for the remainder of the month by featuring a different female member of its workforce each week on its social media channels, along with a link to a brief employee profile on their website.
Through this special campaign, we will recognize women who have made invaluable contributions to this companys success, said
Lampkin Butts
, president and chief operating officer of Sanderson Farms. These leaders are just examples of the many women working behind-the-scenes to keep our company operating at the top of our industry, and I couldnt be more thankful to have their insight and perspective guiding our company decisions each day.
In the U.S., more than half of all farming operations had at least one female operator, according to the 2019 Agricultural Resource Management Survey. The same survey found that women were the principal operator, or the operator primarily responsible for the daily operation of the farm, on 31 percent of farms specializing in poultry.
Today, female leadership is not limited to just farming operations in the agriculture industry. According to a 2019 study conducted by the American Farm Bureau, 27 percent of 3,000 female respondents from 49 states identified their occupation as an agriculture-related business, not including farms or ranches. The same study found that 62 percent of female respondents have the opportunity to lead in the agricultural organization where they are involved.
At Sanderson Farms, the prevalence of women in agriculture is no different. Women account for nearly 45 percent of Sanderson Farms employees and nearly 27 percent of the companys management team, including female directors and division management. Of the new employees hired in fiscal year 2021 at Sanderson Farms, 44 percent were women.
For the nations third largest poultry producer, Sanderson Farms evident confidence in female leadership begins at the top with the companys board of directors. In 2021, the Womens Forum of
New York
recognized Sanderson Farms as a Corporate Champion for having over 40 percent of the companys board seats filled by women.
Since the very beginning of our companys history over 75 years ago, women have been a crucial part of our success, said
Joe F. Sanderson Jr.
, chairman of the board and chief executive officer of Sanderson Farms. Throughout my career, I have been surrounded by women who have led with intelligence, integrity and courage, and, together, we have led this company through a period of growth that has been unparalleled in our industry.
For eight consecutive years, the company was also named a Winning W Company by an advocacy and education group, 20/20 Women on Boards, for its inclusion of women on its board of directors and in leadership positions. In 2021, the same organization, now known as 50/50 Women on Boards, named Sanderson Farms to its Gender Diversity Index with the indexs highest rating of companies with gender-balanced boards. Only seven percent of the companies on the Russel 3000 Index earned this highest rating.
First launched in 2018, Sanderson Farms Women in Agriculture series seeks to spotlight hard-working professionals in vital roles across the company. While these women come from different life, educational and career backgrounds, they all bring unique contributions to our company and the industry.
Just because the agricultural industry is mostly male-dominated, women should not doubt themselves or their abilities, said
Andretta Moore
, field employee relations manager for Sanderson Farms and one of the women being featured in the campaign. Sanderson Farms doesnt just say there are opportunities for women, they are actively placing women into positions of leadership. Whether on the board of directors or as division managers, I have seen Sanderson Farms take the opportunity to place the most qualified people into positions of authority.
In addition to Moore, upcoming features in the campaign include Sanderson Farms employees

227,Live updates: Nordic power firms ready to aid Baltic nations,"Save
COPENHAGEN, Denmark Four Nordic energy companies say they are ready to help the three Baltic nations in the event Russia curbs or completely cuts electricity exports to its smaller neighbors.
Denmarks Energinet, Statnett of Norway, Swedens Svenska kraftnat and Fingrid Oyj of Finland said in a statement theyve secured routines and identified eventual ambiguities in a scenario where the Baltics are disconnected from the Russian grid.
In such a scenario, frequency support from the Nordic system will be needed. The Baltic (Transmission System Operators) have restricted the import from Russia in order not to risk a serious situation in the event of a sudden disconnection from the Russian system, the statement released by Fingrid Oyj said.
Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania are still reliant on their Russian neighbor for much of their electricity needs.

OTHER DEVELOPMENTS:
NEW YORK The deputy head of Russias military general staff says that 1,351 Russian soldiers have died in Ukraine.
Col.-Gen. Sergei Rudskoi also said Friday that 3,825 have been wounded.
NATO estimated on Wednesday that 7,000 to 15,000 Russian soldiers have been killedin four weeks of war in Ukraine.
The Russian figure did not appear to include the Moscow-backed separatists fighting in eastern Ukraine, and it was not clear whether the toll encompassed Russian forces not part of the Defense Ministry, such as the National Guard.
WARSAW, Poland -- Polish President Andrzej Duda was unable to welcome U.S. President Joe Biden on his arrival in Rzeszow due a technical problem with the Polish presidential plane taking him from Warsaw.
Jakub Kumoch, a top adviser to Duda, said Friday that the Polish presidential plane had to make an emergency landing in Warsaw.
The plane landed safely and Duda was waiting for a replacement plane.
MEDYKA, Poland -- Refugees from the war in Ukraine are among those who will be watching the visit of U.S. President Joe Biden to Poland, which began on Friday afternoon with a stop in the eastern Polish city of Rzeszow.
Some hope the visit might bring concrete steps to help their homeland as it is under attack.
Lyra Syniavska, 42, from Lviv, said that Ukrainians expect more help than what they have received so far.
We are getting a lot of help now, really a lot. But our people are still suffering, especially those who lives in the eastern part (of Ukraine), she said.
Alina Sylkina, 26, from the eastern Luhansk region, says she wishes NATO would close the airspace over Ukraine -- though the alliance has said it wont take that step.
During his visit to Rzeszow, Biden will be briefed on the humanitarian response to the refugees streaming out of Ukraine. He will also meet U.S. service members. Biden is due in Warsaw on Saturday.
VILNIUS, Lithuania An exhibition of photos of civilian victims and shelling in Kyiv and Mariupol has been put up at the Vilnius railway station so that travelers on trains crossing Lithuania for the Russian exclave of Kaliningrad will see the images.
The Lithuanian railway said Friday that the 24 photographs were selected by the Lithuanian Press Photographers Club. A text on the photos says in Russian that President Vladimir Putin is killing innocent people in Ukraine today. Are you OK with that?
Lithuanian Railways CEO Egidijus Lazauskas said that the exhibition is a symbolic show of support.
Transit trains run daily from Moscow to Kaliningrad, which is sandwiched between Lithuania and Poland.
At home, Russia has tightly controlled news of what it describes as a special military operation in Ukraine.
COPENHAGEN, Denmark Finlands national railway company says it will suspend services between Helsinki and the Russian city of St. Petersburg from this weekend, closing one of the last public transport routes for Russians who want to reach the European Union.
Citing the sanctions imposed on Russia, the head of passenger traffic with state-owned VR, Topi Simola, said that people who wanted to depart from Russia have had adequate time to leave.
Only the morning train from Helsinki to St Petersburg will be operated on Sunday while the afternoon train will be cancelled. Both services from St Petersburg will be operated. After that, trains will be suspended until further notice.
VR said customers can cancel their tickets at no cost.
GENEVA The U.N. human rights office says its strict methodology in counting casualties in Ukraines conflict has yielded very few confirmed casualties in Mariupol, largely because of difficulties getting access in and information out of the besieged port city.
Matilda Bogner, who heads the rights offices Ukraine branch, noted that council leaders in Mariupol have estimated more than 2,000 civilian deaths in the city following Russias military invasion on Feb. 24.
Overall, the rights office has counted at least 1,035 civilians killed in Ukraine and 1,650 injured but Bogner said it doesnt have a the full picture of locations that have seen intense fighting, in particular Mariupol and Volnovakha. The office has acknowledged that its tally is likely to underestimate the actual toll.
MOSCOW Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov says Russia is facing total war declared by the West.
Lavrov said at a meeting on Friday that a real hybrid war, total war was declared on us. He said the goal was to destroy, break, annihilate, strangle the Russian economy, and Russia on the whole.
During the first month of what Russia describes as a special military operation in Ukraine, the West imposed tough measures targeting Russias economy and financial system as well as President Vladimir Putin and Russian oligarchs.
Despite that, Lavrov said Russia was not isolated.
We have many friends, allies, partners in the world, a huge number of associations in which Russia is working with countries of all continents, and we will continue to do so, Lavrov said. He added that the vast majority of states wont join the Western sanctions policy against Russia.
KYIV, Ukraine Mariupols city government says the Kremlin's main political party has opened a political office in a shopping mall on the outskirts of the besieged city.
According to the post on the citys Telegram channel, the United Russia office is distributing promotional materials as well as mobile phone cards for an operator that functions in the nearby Russia-backed separatist regions.
Mariupols communication links have been all but severed since the siege began in early March. Cell phone, television and radio towers have been targeted in Russian airstrikes and artillery barrages.

234,"New milks from Silk, So Delicious, developed in Colorado, aim to make plant-based milk more like dairy","Senior Reporter, Denver Business Journal
Oct 5, 2021
Danone North America, the company behind leading plant-based beverages Silk and So Delicious, next year will introduce more dairy-like plant-based beverages that aim to win over more traditional milk drinkers.
The Broomfield-based division of Paris-based Danone SA developed the new lines of products at its Louisville research and development center, trying to find the balance of natural plant-based ingredients and flavors to best mimic the mouthfeel and sweet-and-sour taste of cows milk, the company says.
We finally cracked the code for delivering the taste profile, said John Starkey president and general manager of Danone North Americas plant-based products business.
About 40% of U.S. households buy plant-based milks, while 94% buy traditional dairy milk, Danone North America estimates. The new products are aimed at pleasing the 54% of those households that dislike something about plant-based milk and stick solely to traditional dairy.
There are a lot of folks who wont make that leap to plant-based drinks, according to Starkey, because they cant leave the rich and flavorful taste of traditional dairy milk.
The companys new products, called Silk nextmilk and So Delicious Wondermilk, are slated to appear in grocery stores in early 2022. The So Delicious Wondermilk brand will feature new plant-based milk made for use in cooking and baking, company said.
The two new plant-based milk blends add to the large roster of various single-plant milk brands that already make Danone North America the leader in plant-based beverages made from soy, oat, nuts and other ingredients.
The new products aim to expand on that success.
Danone SA sold $2.6 billion worth of dairy milk and plant-based beverages in North America and Europe in the first half of 2021.
In North America, the Horizon Organic Milk diary brand is one of Danones best known
But plant-based drinks account for the fastest-growing portion of the companys North American business, where Silk and So Delicious have driven double-digit sales growth for more than 18 months.
Innovation in plant-based beverages is a priority, or what Danone SA refers to as Plant-based 2.0. Danone, a worldwide company thats home to many different food and beverage and infant formula brands, globally hasnt grown as fast as its investors would like. The company has restructured in recent months including changes that have elevated and tried to build on the successes of its plant-based businesses
Danone introduced a dairy-like, plant-based drink earlier this year, under its Alpro European brand, in Germany and Belgium, and the product has done quite well, the company says.
But the dairy milk that people drink in one part of the world is different from the milk in another due to different cow breeds, climate and feed used.
The dairy-like plant milks are developed to reflect that variety and use different ingredients to match the local texture and flavor profile of the regional dairy, said Takoua Debeche Danone North Americas chief of innovation and research.
She led a team, based out of Danone North Americas lab in Louisville, to determine what makes plant-based milks more like U.S. dairy milk to consumers.
We tested a lot of ingredients along the way, she said.
The Louisville lab worked with dairy experts to break down traditional dairy flavors to understand what part of the tongue and mouth registers flavors for how long. The Danone North America team tried to recreate those profiles with plant-based ingredients.
Dairy milk has a complex flavor profile, Debeche said. Its a mixture of fats and sugars and tastes that feature sour balancing out its sweetness, while also having a specific feel inside the mouth.
Nextmilk and Wondermilk are blends of oat with soy and nut milks and flavor ingredients such as chicory, a plant that brings a slightly nutty richness that offsets the sweet.
The drinks were tested in coffee and over cereal, in drinking by the glass and using in baking before the final recipes were settled upon, Debeche said.
Other innovations have been coming out as well, such as Silks plant-based Greek-style yogurt, which the company introduced in August.
Next year, the So Delicious Wondermilk line will add desserts, with iced cream pints and cones that use a milk formulated to mimic the freezing point and texture of diary, she said.

241,Startup Spotlight:: Naborforce lands spot in prestigious business accelerator,"Save
After the COVID-19 pandemic threw a wrench in its operations in the spring, the Richmond-based startup Naborforce is now getting back to work and has earned a spot in a prestigious, international business accelerator program.
The business, founded by Paige Wilson in 2018, developed an online platform that connects seniors or homebound individuals who need extra help with vetted people called Nabors who are looking to earn some extra cash by providing neighborly services such as grocery shopping and household chores.
Recently, Naborforce was selected as one of just 10 companies worldwide to participate in a fall program by Techstars, a Denver-based business accelerator that provides mentoring and access to investors for promising startup businesses.
The cohort is called The Future of Longevity and focuses on innovative and creative caregiving solutions to address the unmet needs of individuals who are providing and receiving elder care.
From a startup standpoint, this is huge, Wilson said. It is a 13-week program designed help technology companies with a big market opportunity accelerate growth and get them access to sophisticated investors.
From our perspective, it is a huge validation of what we are doing, Wilson said, adding that about 1,000 companies applied for the program.
The selection for Techstars comes after Naborforce recently raised $75,000 in debt funding from three investors, according to a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Wilson said she could not comment on the funding round.
Naborforce is still seeking an additional $225,000 in funding, according to the SEC filing.
As the COVID-19 pandemic hit Virginia in the spring, Naborforce had to suspend its in-home services to clients.
Initially, we suspended anything that was in-person contact and went to everything being virtual or no contact, Wilson said. For instance, Nabors could get groceries for clients but would have to leave them on the porch or doorstep.
Since then, the company has adopted safety protocols for its Nabors and is now allowing them do in-home services again. Around late May, we had clients reaching out and saying, We need your help, Wilson said.
People are feeling the toll of isolation, she said. The whole world understand that now.
Besides its Nabors, Naborforce has three full-time employees in Richmond who manage the platform.
Partnering with Techstars on the fall cohort is Pivotal Ventures, an investment and incubation company created by Melinda Gates. Pivotal Ventures and Techstars said the program is designed to support innovation in caregiving as the United States faces challenges associated with an aging population.
Other companies selected for the cohort, which is being conducted virtually, include MemoryWell, a digital platform that uses storytelling to improve the care of older people; Wysefit, a fitness app created specifically for older people; Candoo Tech, which provides on-demand tech support and training specifically to help older adults stay safe, independent, and connected, and Braze Mobility, which has developed a blind spot sensor system that can be attached to any motorized wheelchair.
The program is going to really position us to begin scaling quickly, with more locations in Virginia and outside Virginia, building a corporate office here in Richmond, and adding two full-time people, Wilson said.",Naborforce,funding round,,,,

266,When Trilogy Health Services wanted to improve its diversity equity and inclusion efforts it turned to UofL's researchers,"Tweet on Twitter
Trilogy Health Services tapped UofL CEHD researchers to help with its DEI efforts.
The collaborative nature between the University of Louisville and Louisville-based senior living and care provider Trilogy Health Services isnt new.
Trilogy Health Services location in Bowling Green, Ohio
All of the companys 110-plus senior living communities participate in UofL Trager Institutes network training hub, for example. Our School of Nursing houses a state-of-the-art simulation lab, upgraded just last year thanks to Trilogys $250,000 commitment.
And it just so happens that Trilogys founder, Randall J. Bufford, is one of our most prominent alums. In 2016, he was named the alumni award winner for the College of Business and just last month earned our inaugural Alumni Ambassador Award. The 1981 graduate was a part of UofLs 1980 national championship mens basketball team. He has since been recognized for his leadership in his profession and community, as Trilogy employs over 10,000 people and is considered to be one of the best senior housing companies in the world.
Geneva Stark
Its no wonder, then, that Trilogy would tap into UofLs expertise to transform its organization to emphasize diversity, equity and inclusion. The companys DEI plan was developed earlier this year with the help of UofL researchers from the College of Education and Human Development, Geneva Stark, Jeffrey Sun, Heather Turner.
UofLs researchers worked alongside Todd Schmiedeler, Trilogys chief engagement and innovation officer, and Priscila Mattingly, Trilogys chief human resources and inclusion officer. The team worked for a year collecting several iterations of data and spoke to every level of employee to capture the companys strengths and improve both employee and resident outcomes.
Jeffrey Sun
Trilogy Health Services has an impressive leadership team and has been dubbed one of the nations best workplaces for aging services. They care about their employees who are truly integrated as community members of the organization. They sought to expand their diversity, equity and inclusion efforts, and building off our existing relationship (which is based on trust and genuine interest in each others success), we also engaged with them on rethinking their practices, policies and priorities to ensure that diversity, equity and inclusion actively and visibly became a critical component of their organizational culture and values, Sun said.
Heather Turner
In fact, they revised their whole Environmental, Social & Governance structure so diversity, equity, and inclusion were not simply words or temporal concerns, but a lived experience where employees felt a sense of belonging and are hopefully having rich and valuable encounters across the company, even with their vendors and partners. Its likely no organization has reached these aspirations, but Trilogy Health Services is trying, and we are honored to be partners with such a caring and focused company, he added.
Together, the UofL and Trilogy team identified four key areas to advance Trilogys DEI efforts: Accountability, recruitment, retention and development, and culture.
Accountability: The DEI plan tasks Trilogys leaders to develop unit-specific and measurable annual diversity goals. The goals are also to be monitored quarterly, so leaders can assess progress and readjust if necessary. Leaders are also tasked with holding regular campus town halls to ensure all employees have a voice in enacting these changes.
Further, Trilogy is conducting an audit of its suppliers to ensure their values are consistent with Trilogys, and the organization will revise supplier contracts to include this consideration.
Recruitment: Trilogy will analyze job postings for content and placement to identify language or phrasing that may deter applicants. The company is also strengthening partnerships with organizations  such as universities and nonprofits  to help facilitate a recruitment pipeline. Finally, the company plans to establish a business resource group for networking  all with an objective of increasing the diversity of its applicant pools.
Retention and development: Trilogy is creating individualized employee growth plans to provide employees with steps for advancement into leadership roles. The plans are paired with advancement and mentorship programs that include training, resources and mentoring.
Culture: Trilogy aims to break down siloes by creating employee resource groups (ERGs) to focus on connecting people with similar interests across campuses and creating a stronger sense of belonging with the company.
This plan has been published in McKnights Senior Living and will be presented next week at the 2021 annual conference of the Association for the Study of Higher Education. This isnt likely the last of the UofL/Trilogy partnership, however.
In the College of Education and Human Development, our commitment is to our community, and since 2019, we have been working with Trilogy to build and enhance its workforce through innovative learning designs such as apprenticeships and workforce diversity, Sun said. Under the leadership of (CEHD) Dean Amy Lingo, we plan to continue expanding our private/public partnerships to learn from each other and increase community engagement.
Natalie Hewlett, CEHDs coordinator for development and communications, contributed to this story.

""Over the last year and a half, we've seen first-hand the burden that's been placed on both our healthcare professionals, who are overwhelmed with patients who need support, as well as our communities, who are desperate for additional mental health resources,"" said Dr. Luciano Fochesatto, Chief Executive Officer, justmiine. ""It's our hope that we can provide relief to those busy providers by offering them the option to effectively manage their patients digitally with Orexo's suite of products, while giving patients access to the mental healthcare they need without setting foot into a busy waiting room.""

The result is care delivery scalability and increased quality of care.
""For more than a decade, Orexo has been committed to improving the availability of effective treatment for mental health issues and addiction, and we're pleased to work with organizations, like justmiine, that share in that commitment,"" said
Dennis Urbaniak
, Executive Vice President, Digital Therapeutics, Orexo. ""Thanks to justmiine's best-in-class software, practitioners who were previously unable to deliver treatment for conditions like depression or problematic alcohol use will now have the ability to do so by incorporating deprexis or vorvida into care plans, thus maximizing the number of patients that can be seen and cared for each and every day.""

The programs are supported by artificial intelligence, which individualizes and tailors content delivery based on the user's progress and specific needs.
Deprexis is one of the most researched digital therapies in the world and is clinically shown to reduce depressive symptoms. Vorvida is a fully automated digital therapy, scientifically proven to change drinking patterns in adults facing problematic alcohol use by offering a new way to manage drinking that does not require in-person groups or complete abstinence.

271,TitletownTech attracts L.A. startup to Green Bay with investment,"ChemDirect
is moving its headquarters to Green Bay after TitletownTechinvested in the company.
Headquartered in Los Angeles, ChemDirect is an early stage company that developed an online marketplace designed specifically for companies that need on-demand chemical supplies. The website connects companies with suppliers selling a wide variety of chemicals like hand sanitizer as well as personal protective equipment like face masks and face shields.
ChemDirect chief executive officer and founder Tyler Ellison founded the company in 2019 to solve supply chain problems in the specialty chemical industry. Ellison, who was formerly CEO of specialty chemical manufacturer Nova Molecular Technologies, says the industry had two major issues manufacturers did not own their customer data and customers were forced to buy chemicals blindly from distributors.
ChemDirects e-commerce solution removes barriers between producer and consumer, taking the typical 20-week supply chain down to one, Ellison said in a statement.
Solving big problems leads to large value creation, Ellison said. Digitizing supply and demand will usher in a new era of transparency, resulting in informed decisions, better economics and optionality for both manufacturers and buyers.
While ChemDirect is TitletownTechs latest investment, the Green Bay-based innovation hub has invested in 14 startups since kicking off its venture studio $25 million venture fund last year. Titletown Tech, which is a Green Bay Packers and Microsoft partnership, aims to make Green Bay a hub for both startups and tech talent.
Of the 14 companies, many have moved into TitletownTechs 13,000 square-foot office space while ChemDirect and Colorado-based Quantum Radius have moved their headquarters to Green Bay.
In StartupBlinks 2020 Global Rankings Report, four Wisconsin cities climbed the ranks of the top 1,000 global cities to start a business. Green Bay, Appleton, Milwaukee and Madison combined moved up 136 spots. All four cities were included in the top 600, but Green Bay made the largest jump rising 44 spots.

274,PCHC to start drive-thru COVID-19 testing,"Drive-thru testing for COVID-19 is now available at the Pineville Community Health Center.
PCHC will begin offering the drive-thru testing on Wednesday, May 20.
Appointments are required. Please call the appointment line at 606-654-4693, Monday thru Friday from 9-5.
Standard days and times for testing will be Mondays and Fridays 11am - 5pm and Saturday from 10am - 2 pm.
Were not limiting it to residents or anything else, its just by appointment only and it takes an order from a doctor or family practice to get the test through the lab company. We can also set it up through our nurse practitioners so that we can write an order for them, PCHS CEO Terry Nichols said. We do bill insurance but there is no cost to the patient. If the patient doesnt have insurance there is a way in Kentucky and well get them set up so that it gets taken care of.
PCHC is also doing antibody blood testing in their lab.
The antibody test is for people that think they have been exposed to it or think they may have had it in the past. They dont have to be showing any symptoms whatsoever, Nichols said. Again, it takes an order from their family practice or through our nurse practitioner, either way.
The drive-thru test is done with a swab of the nasal cavity and results are available within 48 to 72 hours. The hospital will pass the results along to the ordering physician who will then notify the patient.
As we do more tests, the time may extend out. We have some labs that initially got covered up and it was taking four to seven days, Nichols added. Right now its 48 to 72 hours.
Results from the antibody test are usually available in 12 to 24 hours. Nichols said those times could also get lengthened as the number of tests being done increases.
He said PCHC is equipped to handle as many as 200 tests per day.
Friday afternoon the hospital did a test run with Bell County Judge-Executive and Pineville Mayor Scott Madon among the first to be tested along with Jailer Gary Ferguson and Bell County Public Health Director Teresa Hunter and Health Department Nurse Supervisor Trissa Wilder.
When Brock was about to receive the first test, Nichols said they had a special swab just for him and produced a five-foot swab as a joke. The actual testing was done by nurses Mary Bishop and Bonnie Browning.
That wasnt nearly as bad as I expected it to be, Brock said. I would definitely encourage everyone to come and get tested.

276,Suggested expansion to Perrysburg DORA met with mixed reactions from business owners,"12:53 AM EST December 29, 2021
Updated:
12:53 AM EST December 29, 2021
PERRYSBURG, Ohio  The RiverFront Candle Co. in downtown Perrysburg sits smack-dab in the middle of the town's Designated Outdoor Refreshment Area (DORA.)
In 2021, as part of a trial run, people in town were able to move within the area with an adult beverage in hand.
The candle company's owner, Julie Olzka, said it was the perfect mix.
""Folks can come in and create their own candles. They come up with a recipe. They sit at the bar, they blend, pour it into their wax. They wait 90 minutes,"" Olzak said. ""So, most of the time, that's when people are going with their drink and they can walk around, window shop, go onto another store. They can go to a restaurant and then they come back after 90 minutes and pick up their candles.""
So even though her shop doesn't sell drinks, Olzka said that DORA benefits the business community by sharing customers, in a sense.
Directly across from the shop, the owner of Zingo's Restaurant is another fan of DORA.
While she did not want to go on camera to speak about the expansion, she recalled a group of women coming over to grab drinks and then heading back to the candle shop with beverages in hand. The idea of expanding Perrysburg's DORA just makes sense, she said.
""It's a positive,"" Olzak said. ""Yeah, it's been great for us and we're hoping that whoever it goes on to include it works the same way.""
The Sentinel Tribune reports that at Perrysburg's December city council meeting, it had been suggested that DORA's perimeter be expanded into a rectangle to help clarify where the DORA's limits were for patrons. Officers noted it would be easier to enforce if the perimeter was more rectangular in nature.
Yet, at this point, there was no official proposal made at the meeting.
Overall, Olzak said she doesn't see an issue
""Whether it's down the street [or] a block away, within that band we have around us, they can grab a drink,"" she said. ""They can walk down, they can sit in the store. They can enjoy the experience and then they can walk back out with their drink.""
Now, not all of the businesses WTOL 11 spoke with were on board with the idea of expanding DORA.
One owner, who preferred to remain anonymous, said the idea of an expansion could put DORA's lines in residential areas and too close to a nearby church.
That just didn't seem like a good idea to the business owner, who preferred to keep DORA's lines as they are.
More conversation about the expansion is anticipated to happen in 2022.

294,MaineGeneral Health working on contingency plan for staffing as deadline approaches for Mills vaccination mandate,"207-405-2502

AUGUSTA, ME - SEPTEMBER 15: This Wednesday September 15, 2021 file photo shows MaineGenerals Alfond Center for Health in north Augusta. (Staff photo by Joe Phelan/Staff Photographer)
Joe Phelan/Kennebec Journal
AUGUSTA  With Gov. Janet Mills having set a COVID-19 vaccination mandate for health care workers MaineGeneral Health in Augusta is working on a contingency plan for staffing as the Oct. 29 deadline grows nearer.
Spokesperson Joy McKenna said as of Tuesday, about 81% of MaineGenerals employees met the mandates requirements.
On July 31, the Maine Healthcare Worker COVID-19 dashboard data showed 1,121 employees at MaineGeneral were not vaccinated, while 2,830 had received the vaccine. The numbers included all employees, temporary or contract personnel and volunteers or students.
Since the mandate was announced, McKenna said 16 members of the staff had resigned and another 4% had received at least one dose of the COVID-10 vaccine.
As of Tuesday, she said, MaineGeneral had about 520 job openings. That has proved challenging for some parts of MaineGeneral Health, according to McKenna, but the company has not had to close departments due to staffing shortages.
She said the challenges are more a factor of staff members being out because of COVID-19 exposure than employees leaving because of the mandate.
On Aug. 26, five radiation therapists called out of workat MaineGenerals Harold Alfond Center for Cancer Care in Augusta, leading to the cancellation of all appointments for the day.

Record number of COVID patients on ventilators as state cant keep up with new cases
At that time, McKenna said none of the employees mentioned the mandate as a reason for having called out. She added it would be very disappointing if any staff members chose to call out and deny patients the care they deserve.
McKenna said MaineGeneral is doing everything it can to make it easy for employees who need COVID-19 vaccinations to receive them, while also providing information about the coronavirus and vaccination to employees.
Managers have been informed about their employees who are not on record as having received the COVID-19 vaccination so they can talk with them, answer any questions they have and refer them to their PCPs (primary care physicians) for health-related questions about the vaccines, she said.
While MaineGeneral had offered a mass vaccination clinic at the Augusta Civic Center and numerous pop-up clinics in communities with lower-than-average vaccination rates, McKenna said there are no plans to reopen mass vaccination clinics once booster shots are rolled out.
At this time, we are waiting on final guidance from state and federal CDC about potential booster shots, she said. If boosters are recommended, we will continue using our primary care practices for vaccinations.
No additional pop-up clinics are now planned, McKenna said.
As of Tuesday, Kennebec County has had 4,682 confirmed cases, 3,025 probable cases, 87 deaths, 194 hospitalizations and a case rate of 631.3 per 10,000 people since the COVID-19 pandemic begun in March 2020,
according to the Maine Center for Disease Control & Prevention.
Also in Kennebec County, 71,416 of the 122,302 residents,or about 58.4%, have received the final dose of the COVID-19 vaccine, according to state CDC data.
The uptick of COVID-19 incidents in Kennebec County have an impact not only on health care but on area businesses and schools, McKenna said. It is so important that each of us do all that we can to keep ourselves and each other safe.
That includes getting vaccinated, wearing masks at public indoor locations, socially distancing, washing hands and staying home when you are sick. We all need to work together to decrease the spread of COVID-19.

303,108Labs embraces IP incubation model to fund scalable cell-cultured dairy,"108Labs embraces IP incubation model to fund scalable cell-cultured dairy
108Labs embraces IP incubation model to fund scalable cell-cultured dairy
22 Mar 2022 --- 108Labs has unveiled its M2 smart bioreactor milk production platform, bringing the US-based company closer to cell-cultured breast milk and bovine dairy ingredients. In addition, licensing the technology will help bring in extra funding, CEO Shayne Giuliano tells NutritionInsight.
We know we cant build the 170,000 factories needed to replace cows ourselves, so we are building an intellectual property (IP) incubation and B2B business model that can accelerate the field by creating turnkey solutions. Food, dairy and pharmaceutical companies around the world can then leverage these to build their own Pure M2 factories, he states.
By minimizing the barrier to entry for the production of Pure Milks made with M2 and showing what is possible with product development and existing collaborators, 108Labs believes it can convince corporates to invest internally in M2 and Pure.
We can then attract all the capital investments worldwide needed to [improve babies well-being] as soon as possible with Pure Human Milk, and replace cow farming for the majority of the worlds supply of bovine milk by 2040.
Pure Milk is any cell-cultured milk made with Pure Mammary Factors cell medium and growth factors.
Solving all the problems?
Within 108Labs, there are numerous entities including Pure Mammary Factors, which aims to reduce the barrier of entry for Pure dairy product research and product commercialization.
M2 combined with Pure Mammary Factors may solve all the problems with cell-cultured milks, from the first safe to consume cell-cultured milk to scalability to affordability to global accessibility, he states. 
Developing M2 combined with Pure Mammary Factors, in particular, is where we think we can have the biggest impact on convincing companies around the world to invest in cell-cultured milk research now.
This is to get on the path to commercial phase dairy food replacement, humanized infant formula and prescription drugs as soon as possible.
The only way
108Labs believes technology like M2 is the only path to commercializing cell-cultured milks.
It is almost impossible to produce food-grade milk with manual methods because non-food-grade buffers are needed to remove milk bioreactors from incubators by hand to manipulate them.
Therefore, M2 is billed as a turnkey wetware, software and hardware milk-making stack driven by AI to reduce the cost and accelerate the scaling of cell-cultured milk production worldwide.
Giuliano estimates that completion of the first stack could take around 18 to 24 months from now.
Because of the nature of software-driven solutions, once we have completed our first stack  which I actually think of as an artificial cow  our second artificial cow can be built in an hour, he notes.
Giuliano stands in front of redacted M2 architectural design, which reflects plans for cell-cultured cheese.
Taking advantage of bioactivity
Giuliano highlights that M2 is a species-agnostic platform that is engineered to produce replacement milks  not alternative milks.
The same molecules as those found in raw human breast milk or raw bovine milk. Except that M2 produces safe to consume raw milks, which are suitable for therapeutic and food product research and development without pasteurization.
He continues that applications are the same as all current milk applications  if not more.
Humanized infant formula, prescription drugs, cheese, butter, French toast  anything you can make with milk today, except with Pure Milks, we get to take advantage of the full bioactivity of these molecules in a way no one ever has who doesn't drink raw milk.
Guiding investment
Giuliano says the self-funded research incubation model at 108Labs is moving toward licensing and consulting as it transitions to commercial focuses.
We have yet to accept investment at 108Labs, but we have accepted investment in 108Labs-affiliated entities. We expect to attract more investment into product development once we complete the transition from research into commercial phases of cell-cultured milk development over the next three to seven years, he states.
108Labs is also planning to license its emerging fields of cell-cultured milks and antibodies with partners around the world.
We dont talk publicly about our partners because these fields are so competitive, and we want to work with everyone possible to impact the world the most, says Giuliano.
The company does give exclusivity in some cases, at least geographically, but long-term, it wants to support as many partners as possible.
Electron microscopy image of secretory milk IgA immunoglobulins.
Embracing the full-stack approach
Expanding on the meaning of a stack, Giuliano explains full-stack usually includes client software and server software serving some purpose.
In the case of M2, the client is a smart bioreactor that includes hardware and sensors and pumps connected to our AI and server stack, which includes both distributed and centralized computing.
Altogether, this allows 108 Labs to control the operations of milk bioreactors around the world with artificial intelligence from its headquarters in Hillsborough, North Carolina.
Due to the laborious nature of cell-cultured milk production  which is actually a tissue engineering rather than suspension cell-culture biotechnology  we believe that only through automated, AI-controlled solutions and smart stacks that take into account all the hardware, wetware and software requirements can cell-cultured milks become commercially successful, Giuliano emphasizes.
The road ahead
108Labs has numerous worlds first goals for the next two years, including launching a turnkey smart bioreactor platform capable of producing any species of cell-cultured milk, FDA-approved cell-cultured milk, affordable food-grade medium and growth factors and a replacement cell-cultured cheese.
Were also targeting the first human milk prescription drug to enter trials and the first infant formula using fully human molecules, says Giuliano.
All these goals come from a simple focus on mastering mammary cells. Everything we do right now moves us close to all these goals. We can only achieve all these goals at once by building collaborations with companies that can invest and develop these products with our help, Giuliano emphasizes.

306,UPI-like interface for healthcare services may go live this week,"Income-Tax notices give FPIs the jitters; experts suspect tech glitches
The United Health Interface (UHI), which will allow the interoperability of health services like the united payments interface (UPI) has done for payments, will go live this week.
Dr R S Sharma, CEO of National Health Authority (NHA), said: UHI will go live this week. We are putting UHI as a platform and inviting the entire community to contribute with their feedback. We are working on it very fast and I believe we will be as successful as UPI (United Payments Interface).
UHI is in line with UPI. UPI is a language of money transfer, similarly, UHI is a set of protocols, which is going to create a language of health service delivery,he added.
Sharma was speaking at the 16th edition of India Digital Summit 2022 organised by Internet And Mobile Association of India (IAMAI). Privacy and data protection was a recurrent focus of the first day of the summit which adopted the theme of Supercharging start-ups for this edition.
Privacy is not a zero sum game. It is a typical myth that to have privacy you have to sacrifice some functionalities. We have worked in a federated architecture which means we don't put the data in one place as it can become a single point of failure, said Dr Sharma.
Google India MD and IAMAI Chairman Sanjay Gupta said, We have to ensure privacy and safety of people on the internet. Winning the trust of a billion Indians is going to be critical and we can't leave our doors open to bad actors and leave it to law enforcement to bring them to book.
Start-ups will play a pivotal role in achieving a trillion-dollar economy by 2025 from 250 billion dollars currently. Today, startups employ half a million people in India. That means, we need to focus on the right enablers for the growth -- regulatory framework, right infrastructure, to ensure digital economy can grow equitably. Also, we need to ensure a safer internet, he added.
UIDAI CEO Saurabh Garg said that the next leg of Aadhaar based innovations will be in areas like confidential computing, quantum computing-led cybersecurity infrastructure, faster biometric solutions and blockchain based products to make the authentication system more decentralised and secure.
The Aadhaar chief said that over 50 million Aadhaar authentications are taking place per day and over 400 million last-mile banking transactions are being done every month through Aadhaar-enabled Payment System (AePS).
He reiterated that for individual residents Aadhaar authentication is free and will always remain free. Recently, UIDAI had slashed the price for authentication to Rs 3 from Rs 20 per instance to enable entities to leverage its infrastructure for providing ease of living to people through various services and benefits.

309,The stimulus programs are important to us': Small businesses look to federal stimulus funds to maintain payroll and rent,"Save
Just a month ago, the Richmond-based startup company Naborforce was seeing its business grow at a substantial pace.
Then came the coronavirus outbreak, forcing the company to drastically scale back its business, which provides an online platform that enables people called ""Nabors"" to earn some extra cash by providing neighborly services such as grocery shopping and household chores to senior citizens or other homebound people.
""Obviously, we are at the eye of the storm,"" Naborforce founder Paige Wilson said. ""Our entire business is built around connection, and especially connection with seniors.""
Instead of connecting with seniors, Wilson has spent much of this week applying for the federal government stimulus money available to small businesses after Congress approved the CARES Act, or the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act.
""I think all of the stimulus programs are important to us,"" Wilson said.
The $2.2 trillion economic stimulus law includes almost $350 billion in federally guaranteed loans for small firms with fewer than 500 employees under what is called the ""Paycheck Protection Program."" The loans are forgivable if the funds are spent on payroll, and interest on rent, mortgage and utilities.
The loans are expected to be available starting Friday April 3 for businesses, although it may take longer for some businesses to see the money.
The stimulus program is designed around protecting and preserving payrolls as much as possible - businesses can apply for loans for as much as 2.5 times their average monthly payroll costs, though it does exclude salary amounts in excess of $100,000.
So a hypothetical business that had $10,000 in average monthly payroll could quality for a loan of $25,000. There are limits on how much of the loan is forgivable, depending on how the business uses the loan money and how many of its employees it keeps on its payroll.
""The whole point of the program is to encourage small businesses to keep people employed even when they dont have the revenue to do that today,"" said Bruce Whitehurst, president and chief executive officer of the Virginia Bankers Association.
Most banks in Virginia also are trying to work with businesses impacted by the coronavirus on loan extensions, Whitehurst said.
""What I am hearing as the norm for small business loans and commercial loans is up to a six-month extension on loans,"" he said. ""I think you would be hard pressed to find a bank not doing that.""
Businesses should work with their accountant and bankers to access the loans, said those with the Henrico County-based accounting firm of Keiter.
Business owners also should be prepared to have documentation available to apply for the stimulus loans, especially quarterly and annual payroll reports, said Matt Austin, managing director at Keiter, and Scott Zickefoose, a senior director for Keiter.
""There is going to be a lot that is clarified"" in the coming weeks, Austin said. ""For any business it would be smart to make sure you coordinate and stay in touch with your lender, your [legal] counsel if you have one, and your accountant.""
Among other highlights of the loan program:
The loans are available through financial institutions approved by the U.S. Small Business Administration. Applications for loans are also posted on the U.S. Treasury Department's website at home.treasury.gov
The loans are generally available to businesses and nonprofits with fewer than 500 employees, though there is some flexibility on the number of employees depending on the industry.
Sole proprietors, independent contractors, self-employed individuals and veteran's organizations with fewer than 500 employees also are eligible.
The loan amount cannot exceed $10 million. Loans are available through June 30, though the fund could quickly be depleted, Austin said.
Payroll costs can include salaries, tips, commissions, vacation pay, parental leave pay, the employer-paid portion of group health-care benefits, retirement benefits, state and local tax associated with compensation, and payments to any independent contractor.
While the loans are expected to be available starting Friday for businesses, independent contractors and self-employed individuals can apply starting April 10.
""There is some information that the loans are going to be available in a one- to two-week timeline,"" said Barry Duval, president and chief executive officer of the Virginia Chamber of Commerce. ""Obviously, every week is important to a small business.""
""The [chamber] members I have spoken with are desperate for solutions today, and they are looking for help immediately,"" Duval said. ""If there is one concern I have about government programs, it is the speed to market. I think it is yet to be proven if the speed to market is good enough.""
Todd Curran, founder and CEO of Richmond-based Savage Apparel Co., a maker of sports apparel for amateur athletics such as ultimate Frisbee and dodgeball leagues, said his company is seeking both loans through the payroll protection program and applying for an emergency, economic injury grant of up to $10,000 through the SBA, a separate relief program of the stimulus.
The company completed a merger early this year with Seattle-based Five Ultimate, along with its sister company ARIA Discs, a producer of ultimate discs, before the coronavirus pandemic hit. The company was looking to add more employees.
But then it had to furlough about half of its 31 employees, many of whom worked at the company's office and production operations off West Brookland Park Boulevard in North Richmond.
""Anything is good right now"" to help the company bridge the economic crisis, Curran said.
The emergency loans, which are also part of the stimulus bill, ""allows us to keep some of the people on payroll while we wait for the [payroll protection] loan to come through,"" he said. ""It allows us to jumpstart instead of waiting.""
He hopes the company will see a return in demand once social distancing rules are eased and people can get back to sports activities.
Naborforce, which was serving the Richmond and Charlottesville markets and planning to expand into the Williamsburg and Raleigh, N.C., markets before the pandemic, is still trying to offer some services such as grocery drop-offs, and it continues to get inquiries from people looking to become ""nabors.""
But social distancing rules and the sudden, dramatic downturn in the economy have forced the startup to cut back on its staff from four full-time employees and one contractor to just two full-time employees. Naborforce's Wilson hopes to be able to use the stimulus funds to keep her staff working and maintain the platform.
""The very at-risk population we were serving, we cannot serve in the manner we were"" because of social distancing and ""stay-at-home"" rules now in place to prevent the spread of COVID-19, Wilson said. She described the situation now as ""heartbreaking to say the least, because actually in some ways our clients need us more now than ever.""

310,ieso Raises $53m to Address Global Mental Health Crisis With Digital Therapeutics,"ieso
, a UK leader in digital mental healthcare, today announces the completion of its $53 million Series B financing round led by investment firm Morningside with further new investment from Sony Innovation Fundand existing shareholders IP Group Molten Venturesand Ananda Impact Ventures
Each year, 1 in 5 people experience a mental condition and depression is estimated to cost the global economy $1 trillion. At the same time, there are less than 4 mental health workers per 100,000 people in half the worlds countries. The growth in wellness and mental health apps aims to meet this demand, but there is currently a lack of clinically-evidenced digital therapeutics for treating diagnosed mental health conditions.
The funds raised will help ieso address this global mental health crisis by developing autonomous therapy systems that match the high standards of human care delivery, at significantly lower cost to health systems. These new tools could improve the lives of the 500 million people globally who struggle with their mental and behavioral health every day but cannot access appropriate personalized care.
iesos AI-enabled digital assessment tools and therapeutics for mental health conditions will build on the insights developed from the worlds largest outcomes-linked therapy dataset, which surpasses 460,000 hours. The data encompasses insight into, and treatment of, common mental health conditions including depression and anxiety and those linked with long term conditions such as diabetes.
ieso intends to seek regulatory approval for its autonomous digital tools in the US and UK ahead of bringing them to those markets. The company will extend its commercial teams to the US and target co-development and distribution partnerships that can facilitate scalable market access.
ieso will also continue to make its digital therapy service available to more than 20 million people in the UK via existing partnerships, including with the NHS. Working with its network of highly-qualified therapists and wellbeing practitioners, ieso will develop products that work in a real-world clinical setting and strive to maintain the continual recovery improvements it has seen over the past five years.
Commenting on the successful Series B financing, Nigel Pitchford, CEO of ieso, said:At ieso, were looking to transform global mental health by unlocking the power of clinical data to develop AI-enabled digital therapeutics. Our experience delivering outstanding mental health care within the NHS ideally places us for starting to tackle this challenge. A new generation of clinically-validated digital mental health care products could ultimately improve millions of lives. But we cannot do this alone, and look forward to working with our patients, clinicians, investors, as well as existing and future partners, to better serve those who require mental health support.
Stephen Bruso, Morningside Ventures, who also joins the Board, commented:iesos advanced AI-driven digital therapeutics platform is further evidence of the power of data in the realm of mental health. By pairing one of the worlds largest databases in cognitive behavioural therapy, with sophisticated AI algorithms, ieso is delivering improved mental health care to patients with significant unmet need. We are proud to partner with them in this endeavor.
Dr Andy Richards CBE, Chairman of ieso, added:We are in a global mental health crisis. There are simply not enough clinicians to assess and treat the growing number of people who need help. Whilst we have seen an explosion in the number of mobile apps to help address mental health conditions, there is an urgent need for true digital therapeutics which have been approved for treating patients. Through the support of our investors, who share our purpose, well continue on our mission of combining clinical expertise, data science and technology to enable better and more accessible mental healthcare.

About the global mental health crisis
With 1 in 4 people in the UK, and 1 in 5 in the US, having a diagnosable mental health condition and less than half of those affected receiving treatment, the need for clinically evidenced recovery based digital therapies has never been more pressing.
Poor mental health is a leading cause of disability worldwide. On any given day, around 500 million people meet the criteria for a common mood disorder, with over 264 million people affected by depression alone.
Two of the most common mental health conditions, depression and anxiety, cost the global economy US$ 1 trillion each year. Despite these figures, the global median of government health expenditure that goes to mental health is less than 2%.
In addition, the link between poor mental health and deteriorating physical health especially in long term conditions such as diabetes is well established, and adds an even greater imperative to effective mental health treatment.
About digital therapeutics
Digital therapeutics (DTx) are regulatory-approved, evidence-based therapeutic interventions driven by software to prevent, manage, or treat a medical disorder or disease. DTx are predicted to be a $56 billion global opportunity by 2025.
DTx look to treat chronic and behavioral conditions, which account for the majority of healthcare spending. Examples of interventions include mobile health and wellness apps that replace or complement the existing treatment of a disease. They are distinct from the broader digital health sector due to a focus on",ieso,funding round,regulatory approval,new initiatives or programs,product updates,

321,Oasis Growth fuelled by Agility and Resilience,"Comment
Kiran Gadela (CEO)-Oasis Fertility
COVID-19 has put unrivaled exertions on the healthcare sector, and when the pandemic struck for the first time, the sectors' resilience was put to test, forcing the entire system to bring innovative technologies to the market. The revolutionary technology of in-vitro fertilization (IVF) has been a savior for families struggling with infertility, enabling them to experience the joy of parenthood.
According to the data by World Health Organisation, around 48 million couples and 186 million individuals have infertility globally. Over the last two decades, fertility rates have been continuously declining in India. Also, to the most recent statistics from the National Family Health Survey, India's fertility rate has been deteriorating, with the 2019-21 survey putting it at an all-time low of 1.6 in the urban population and 2.1 in the rural population. To top it, various factors like changing lifestyle and a significant number of the sub-fertile population contribute to the increased demand for infertility treatments.
Due to an increase in infertility rates, the IVF sector is predicted to grow at a CAGR of 20% in the upcoming years. IVF is one of the most widely known types of assisted reproductive technology (ART). It works by using a combination of medicines and surgical procedures to help sperm fertilize an egg and then implanting the egg in the uterus.
As the pandemic situation improved with time, the demand for IVF clinics and their services resumed while following the guidelines that ensured the safety and security of the patients and staff, like social distancing, wearing a mask and regular fumigation and deep cleaning of the premises, and sanitization of hands and equipment used for medical procedures.
During the first wave, the fear factor was at its highest. We did our best to adhere to international safety protocols to overcome pandemic anxiety and encourage couples to resume their plans to start a family. We did everything we could to keep the couples and our employees safe during the pandemic, from vaccinating our employees to spacing out consultations and offering online counseling says Kiran Gadela, Co-founder and Managing Director, Oasis Fertility a leading chain of fertility clinics in India.
The company introduced an innovative initiative IVF @ Home to overcome the COVID apprehensions and fright patients have while seeking treatment at the hospital. Here, IVF is being provided at the doorstep of the patient, with minimal visits to the clinics, thereby reducing any risks of getting COVID infected.
Within 3 months of the first wave, we came up with this concept. We aimed to reduce the fear and worry of couples and encourage them to begin their parenthood journey without any difficulty, even during difficult times, with the help of our committed and agile multidisciplinary teams. This special project arose because we knew the outbreak was here to stay, and deferring pregnancy is not a viable choice as fertility declines with age adds Sudhaker Jadhav, Chief Operating Officer, Oasis Fertility.
During the first two waves, people put their conception plans on hold- first due to the COVID 19 fright, but eventually people started realizing that there is no end in sight. With the world now going through the third wave with the Omicron variant and couples knowing that COVID 19 is here to stay, IVF clinics are observing the inflow of patients in 2022 compared to that of 2021 and 2020. Moreover, there have been changes in consumer behavior and the severe and long-term economic effect is still being felt by the healthcare sector.
Despite the economy's slowing growth, technological developments, particularly post-pandemic, have benefited the health business. Only those who were able to adapt to the new normal survived.
Recent research by WHO shows one in six couples (globally) has some degree of infertility issue. India collectively is doing 3,00,000 IVF cycles and the need is expected to be almost ten times the current number. Oasis Fertility is striving to fill the gaps in the segment, they have added 8 more centres in this year taking the count to 25 centres.
Our relentless focus on technology, clinical excellence and a scientific approach in all we do contributes to (a) best in class success rates and (b) a transparent and seamless experience of the couples seeking treatment through the use of technology-enabled solutions. It's been a gratifying year thus as we doubled our growth from the previous year. We have a clear road map to onboard and train more senior fertility specialists and embryologists - and deepen our presence into tier ii and tier iii cities of India as well.  adds Kiran Gadela.
As the pandemic caused a paradigm shift in the entire healthcare ecosystem, organized fertility chains like Oasis Fertility are leaving no stone unturned in terms of thought leadership, creating awareness, and trying to dispel misconceptions about infertility. They also focus on educating people about the wide range of treatment possibilities and instill faith and hope in the couples seeking treatments.

323,This is our way of saying thank you to Hull's health and social care heroes,"Previous winners at the Hull Health & Care Awards
(Image: Jerome Ellerby)
They are heroes - it is time to say thank you.
The Herculean efforts of our health and care workers during the many dark hours of the
have left an indelible imprint in all our memories.
And Jack Latus, of
Latus Health
firmly believes that now is the time to showcase those who have inspired and cared for us. In short, to say a huge thank you.
North Ferriby-based Latus Health is the headline sponsor of this year's
Hull Health and Care Awards
The event on Tuesday, June 22 will take place virtually.
""We are really keen to support the
Hull Health & Care Awards
event, because this year more than ever it is truly an occasion to celebrate the fantastic work and give the recognition so richly deserved for the healthcare professionals and carers in our region,"" says Jack.
""As a nation I think we are all very proud of our healthcare workers and this has been highlighted throughout the pandemic. The ability to adapt to deliver the Covid-19 emergency response including the world-leading vaccine campaign has been truly phenomenal.
North Ferriby-based Latus Health is the headline sponsor of this year's Hull Health and Care Awards
""We have seen countless examples, throughout the last year, of outstanding selflessness and dedication to ensure the safety of our community throughout unprecedented times, for which no one was prepared.
""For one evening per year we can put our local healthcare services on centre stage and give that small amount of recognition to the thousands of healthcare professionals who look after us all when we need them, and we are all probably guilty of taking for granted at times.
""There are too many examples of heroic actions over the last 12 months to be able to give awards for them all individually, but it is essential that as a community we show our appreciation, and I think that by ensuring this awards night is given the support and awareness it deserves we can do that.""
Particularly poignant, says Jack, when you consider the mental and physical strain on our nurses, doctors and carers.
Hull Daily Mail Health & Care Awards 2019

""I cannot imagine the emotional stress it must cause a nurse to have to tell family members that they are not allowed to enter the hospital to say goodbye to a dying loved one or even for a friend or partner to be able to visit a patient for support as we normally would,"" he says.
""It is all too easy to say, 'nurses and doctors are just doing their jobs', but its important to remember that, throughout the pandemic, these heroes have been doing far more than could ever have been expected when accepting their job roles.""
As a healthcare business, Latus Health has also seen first-hand the challenges of delivering healthcare services in a pandemic.
The company, specialists in occupational health services, has been busy focusing on the well-being of firms, and their employees, during the pandemic.
Broadcaster and journalist Helen Fospero at the Hull Health & Care Awards 2019

Jack says: ""The services we deliver are rarely a matter of life and death - but we have still had to ask our team to put the health of the employees we look after above their own, and this is something that has made me, personally, very proud of our team. I cannot thank them enough for their efforts over the last 12 months.""
And it has also been a time of growth for Latus, which is integral to the East Yorkshire economy.
""In this last year, we have added to our team of 30 full time employees to provide jobs to over 100 additional local people, and more across the UK,"" says Jack.
""This additional workforce has allowed us to scale up our healthcare delivery to give more businesses access to our corporate health services. Our core service is the provision of occupational health testing but our full spectrum employee health programmes also includes mental health training, counselling and many other health initiatives to help improve employee well-being.
Taking time to chat at Hull Health & Care Awards 2019
(Image: Jerome Ellerby)
""Our ethos and mission is to improve the accessibility of well-being services to all employees across the UK, but as a Hull-centric business the work we do benefits the health of the local working population. The health of our local workforce is paramount to the success of our local economy and the growing Hull Powerhouse and our aim is certainly to increase the impact we have locally by working with more Hull and East Riding businesses.
""Transitioning out of the Covid pandemic, there is an increased awareness of the importance of our health and this will be evident in the prioritising of employee health on corporate agendas. Previously, employee well-being was viewed as a nice to have, but is now becoming a key aspect of resilient businesses and top priority for businesses aiming to thrive in a post pandemic world.""

The Newest Cannabinoids: THCP and CBDP
Lets start with Microbes.
According to the National Institute of Health, Microbes are tiny living things that are found all around us and are too small to be seen by the naked eye. They live in water, soil, and in the air. The human body is home to millions of these microbes too, also called microorganisms. Some microbes make us sick; others are important for our health. The most common types are bacteria, viruses, and fungi. There are also microbes called protozoa. These are tiny living things that are responsible for diseases such as toxoplasmosis and malaria.
How do the different decontamination technologies work?
Ozone
(and other chemical-based decontamination) is a surface technology, meaning it only works on what it touches. If it cant enter a tight compacted flower as an example, it cant reach the microbes on the inside (imagine blowing smoke at a clinched fist, the tighter the clinch, the less penetration of the gas). Breaking open the flower for testing exposes the untreated inside of the flower and microbes that are still growing. In addition to not being able to penetrate to the center of the flower, ozone is an oxidizer that strips terpenes from the flower while changing the flowers color from green to brown.
Another technology is Radio Frequency (RF). This technology is similar to a microwave oven where it uses moisture to generate heat by oscillating water molecules. If moisture in the flower lot is uneven, it can result in hot spots when processing which will damage the flower and could start the decarboxylation process from THC to THCA.
Photonic Decontamination (PD) is a process that uses photons (light) to penetrate the whole flower and inactivate the microbe by breaking the DNA. With no ability to grow, the microbes are unable to repopulate with no further ability to contaminate the product. The only way for the microbes to repopulate the flower is through cross-contamination and re-introduction from another source. A process that does not happen with PD as the processing bags remain sealed during process and up to the point when the samples are pulled for testing.

326,Osteoma Cutis and Calcinosis Cutis: Similar but Different,"2020;13(11):2831

No funding was provided for this study.
DISCLOSURES:
The authors have no conflicts of interest relevant to the content of this article.
ABSTRACT: The development of calcium salt deposits in the skin can occur in the presence or absence of membranous ossification and are categorized into osteoma cutis (i.e., cutaneous osteoma) and calcinosis cutis. For the former, distinction into primary or secondary osteoma cutis is mainly based on clinical and histopathological parameters, as primary osteoma cutis originates without any underlying intradermal inflammatory or neoplastic process, as opposed to a far greater number of secondary osteoma cutis that occur on the grounds of inflammation or tumors. Genetic disorders might predispose a person to the formation of these overall rare tumors. However, some patients develop primary osteoma cutis in the absence of any genetic background. In pre-menopausal women with fair skin, the condition of multiple miliary osteoma cutis is a relevant differential diagnosis for solid subcutaneous facial nodules. While pathogenesis remains unclear, most affected individuals have suffered from acne vulgaris at some point. Excision might be a viable option for disturbing lesions, as are ablative lasers. Here, we discuss and review relevant causes of calcium salt deposits in the skin based on a notable case of multiple primary osteoma cutis of the face in an otherwise healthy woman.
KEYWORDS:
Osteoma, osteoid, calcinosis, pseudohypoparathyroidism, acne vulgaris
Osteoma cutis (OC) is a benign condition defined as the eruption of an osseous structure in the skin, and is distinguishable from calcinosis cutis (CC).
1
The former arises from membranous ossification without cartilage as a precursor; an interchangeable term is cutaneous osteoma. The latter is defined by calcium salt deposits in the absence of osteoid, which itself comprises osteoblasts, osteoclasts, and hydroxyapatite as obligatory components.
OC may be divided into a primary and secondary type, depending on the clinical and histopathological parameters. Primary OC originates without any underlying intradermal inflammatory or neoplastic process, whereas secondary OC is most often associated with chronic inflammatory diseases that lead to the degradation of collagen fibers, with other causes, including trauma and neoplasms.
2,3
Traditionally, four types of primary OC have been distinguished: isolated, plaque-like (also plate-like), widespread, and multiple miliary osteoma cutis (MMOC).
CC can be divided into a dystrophic type, which is associated with tissue damage, and a metastatic type, which is due to elevated calcium or phosphate levels. The remaining cases are either iatrogenic or idiopathic CC, which are later discussed. The severe condition of calciphylaxis, defined by generalized calcium deposits in the small vessels, will not be further discussed in this article.
Here, we describe a rare case of multiple subcutaneous nodules on the forehead of an otherwise healthy female patient, which could be identified as symptomatic primary OC in the absence of a predisposing genetic background. Furthermore, we provide a short review of the diagnostic and therapeutic options both for OC and CC.
Case Report
History.
A 39-year old Caucasian female patient (Fitzpatrick Skin Type III) sought consultation in our clinic due to the development of slowly extending solid subcutaneous nodules on her forehead. Small lesions had been noticed initially during her first pregnancy eight years earlier. There were no relevant comorbidities or comedications, nor was there any family history of dermatological diseases. During childhood, she had required sutures to the left side of her forehead, but no injury or trauma was reported apart from that. In adolescence, the patient suffered from moderate acne vulgaris, though she had received no specific treatment at that time. Continued occasional manipulation of the facial skin was reported upon questioning, which we interpreted as a mild form of excoriation disorder. However, according to the patient, this behavior did not result in any scarring skin lesions. The patient requested a therapy for the most bothersome nodules, as they were causing tenderness upon palpation and she described a feeling of disfigurement.
Laboratory investigations.
Serum levels of calcium, phosphate, and parathormone were normal. There was no evidence of organ dysfunction (renal, hepatic) and the full blood count was normal. The 25-OH-vitamin D level was low: 11.9ng/ml (20 to 70ng/ml).
Clinical picture.
Multiple firm subcutaneous nodules measuring 1 to 4mm in diameter were dispersed, but strictly limited to the forehead. There was no erythema or clinical clues to indicate active acne vulgaris or rosacea (Figure 1). A full body examination revealed no signs of autoimmune disorders, such as systemic sclerosis or lupus erythematodes.
Histology.
Consent was granted, and we performed a full excision of the largest lesions. Upon histological examination, there were plentiful pale eosinophil material within the cutis and subcutis, which was identified as mature osteoid due to its lamellar arrangement without any spicules or dysplastic features. Processing of the paraffin embedded sections triggered artificial tears. There were no signs of hematopoiesis (Figures 2 and 3) or any relevant inflammatory infiltrate, and, in particular, there was no chronic granulomatous foreign-body type reaction. Apart from the pronounced seborrheic glands, no other specific features or histopathologic signs of underlying chronic inflammatory skin diseases could be detected.
Outcome.
The patient was satisfied with the cosmetic result. Although repeated treatment might be necessary in the future in case of extension of the remaining lesions or de novo eruption of more OC. In the absence of evidence based preventive measures, no further therapy was proposed, apart from the correction of the low Vitamin D level by supplementation. It was advised that skin picking should be ceased if possible; counseling, including behavioral treatments, could be beneficial as a supportive measure.
Discussion
OC usually appears as solid, skin-colored subcutaneous nodules of variable sizes and shapes. Signs of inflammation might also be present. The area of predilection is the face, and subcutaneous nodules of the face might resemble a multitude of different diagnoses, including benign and malign tumors and infectious or inflammatory diseases. In younger otherwise healthy patients, epidermoid cysts, fibromas, and lipomas are among the most frequent differential diagnoses. Skin-colored papules on the face, in combination with seborrhea, are likely to be closed comedones of acne vulgaris.

328,Pathway Senior Living Rebrands as 'Pathway to Living',"Send email
Pathway Senior Living has a new name and logo. The Chicago-based provider, which operates 24 communities across Illinois, Kansas, Minnesota, and Wisconsin, will be known as Pathway to Living, effective today.
About seven years ago, Pathway set about creating its Viva! operating model and company culture, and the time came for a new name to better reflect what the company has now become, COO Maria Oliva told Senior Housing News.
It starts with the premise that life needs to be valued and meaningful at every stage, Oliva said. The way we approach that is to create environments where our residents come to live with purpose.
Advertisement
That sense of purpose is instilled by learning about residents aspirations, and helping them achieve these aspirations by doing things with them, not for them, she said. The Viva approach encourages active engagement in a wide range of activities, from learning new skills to horseback riding and hot air ballooning.
We decided it was time for the company name to reflect what makes us different, Oliva said.
Advertisement
Part of the change was to drop the word senior. This is in response to a widespread recognition that consumers do not connect strongly with the senior terminology, and also was a way to differentiate Pathway and emphasize its mission of being a place where older adults are not defined by their age, and do not lose their identity or purpose.
I think were really making progress in appealing to the influencer today, who is doing the legwork [that goes into] buying this product, Oliva said. That consumer relates to the fact that senior living is not a last resort. It should be a normal progression of where you live at that stage of life, to allow you to be happy, healthy, and independent, as opposed to dependent on family.
The company stuck with Pathway intentionally in its new name, keeping that brand equity. Individual communities will still be known by their current names, as well; only the corporate parent is switching over to the new branding.
The new logo also is a blend of old and new. Its more colorful than the former all-green logo, but incorporates similar imagery of paths.
We really wanted, in a creative manner, to still connect people to this brand based on the life path they may be on, Oliva said.

336,A day in the life of a health-informatics COO during Covid-19,"Digitising patient records and eliminating the need for paper-based case notes has saved the NHS millions of pounds and enabled thousands of clinicians to spend more quality time with their patient and less time digging around a paper file.
What have been your biggest challenges and how did you navigate those?
One of the challenges I quite often come across is due to the size of the company. Epro is growing, but because were still somewhere around start-up size, people in all teams wear many hats in their day-to-day job. For example, professional and technical services deliver projects, represent support, create documentation, liaise with the release team, speak to development and get involved in testing and Q&A.
On a busy day, up to 80 different tasks come my way and keeping track of all of them requires both a good whiteboard (we recently introduced a digital solution for that and the multitude of tasks on there is mind-boggling when visualised!) and a level head to prioritise things.
Having dedicated meetings with the relevant teams on a regular basis helps open communication channels and ensures everyone is on the same page. As a bonus, sticking to the timescales for these meetings considerably improves staff morale.
I had situations where the customer mistook me for the coffee lady in onsite meetings. It does show how gender bias takes place without great fanfare and without malice
FRANCESCA LEITHOLD
On a more general note, the technology companies and the IT departments in NHS Trusts we work with are still predominantly run by white men (with a majority of male employees). This isnt always their fault; the number of female applicants for technical jobs we have seen here at Epro has been very limited. In many cases, women still choose less tech-heavy career paths, leading to an underrepresentation of female employees.
Consequently, subconscious bias seems to be very common. While I have never encountered any challenges at Epro based on gender, I had situations where the customer mistook me for the coffee lady in onsite meetings. It does show how gender bias takes place without great fanfare and without malice.
To address this, there is sometimes a requirement to be a little bit extra-prepared, when you are (the woman) in charge of a project or task, to have done just that small bit more reading than your (male) colleagues.
What advice would you give someone interested in working in a role similar to yours?
Persist. Have an idea of what you want to do and stick with it. If there is anything in your career you want to achieve, dont let anyone tell you that you cant.
For the women among us, go the extra mile and be extra dedicated. You will set an example for other women, thus driving change and making the workplace more equal by encouraging them to go for a similar career path. Dont compare yourself to others too much, but be yourself and be as authentic as you can.
Especially for women in high-performing jobs, we feel we need to prove a lot. Trying to be someone else is a likely path to failure, so dont try. It is great to aim for better performance, to strive for excellence, to try to achieve more. Do it for yourself and for your team, not because you think other people are doing a better job.
If you lead a team, be transparent. Be convinced of what you do, why you do it and communicate this accordingly. I strongly feel that if people understand why they have been given a task, they will do it better. Definitely ensure there is someone owning the project or task and is accountable. Ensure your people know who they can expect leadership and line management from. Engage people according to their strengths in different tasks and give them room to thrive. Dont micromanage.
Most important of all, from time to time, check in with yourself that what you set out to do is still what makes you happy. If it isnt, it is okay to change things and do something else instead. Accept who you are, what your strengths are and make the most out of them. Its your career make it shine.",Epro,executive statement,,,,

344,Balhousie celebrates historic victory following Supreme Court ruling,"LinkedIn
Leading Scottish care home operator Balhousie has won a lengthy legal battle over VAT allowance.
In a landmark decision, the Supreme Court ruled in favour of the care home operator over a VAT decision on the sale and leaseback of one its care homes.
The Value Added Tax Act 1994 makes a zero VAT allowance for companies that are involved in the construction or conversion of buildings used for relevant residential or charitable purposes. If the building use is changed or the company disposes of the property, then that zero VAT allowance is clawed back and the company is expected to pay VAT.
Story continues below

The judges at the Supreme Court decided that the transaction did not trigger one of the claw back criteria, however, and therefore agreed that the zero VAT allowance should still apply.
Lucy McCann, litigation partner at Brodies LLP who advised Balhousie, said: We expect the Supreme Courts ruling on Balhousies case to have a significant impact on the use of sale and leaseback structures, providing clarity that such vehicles can retain a zero rating for VAT, if appropriately structured. This decision extends beyond the care home sector and will be welcomed by both business and professional advisers.
Tony Banks, Chairman of Balhousie Care Group, which celebrates its 30th anniversary this year, (pictured) said: This is not only a historic victory in the legal sense but also for the business community as a whole. I am delighted with the unanimous Supreme Court ruling and proud that we kept the faith during what became a lengthy and costly legal process. Huge thanks are due to Brodies for navigating previously uncharted legal territory.

356,State officials seek to shut down embattled day care,"State officials seek to shut down embattled day care
Marisa Kwiatkowski
View Comments
State officials are taking action to shut down the Far-Northside day care where an employee was accused of molesting a 4-year-old girl.
The Indiana Family and Social Services Administration mailed a letter Thursday to Children's Choice Learning Center to let the day care officials know the state was revoking their license. In the six-page letter, state officials blasted the day care for its employees' failure to immediately report suspected child abuse as required by law.
""We were surprised to receive this notice today because we had been working with licensing to address the violations,"" said Bridget Perry, a spokeswoman for Bright Horizons Children's Centers LLC, which operates the day care.
An Indiana day care inspector cited Children's Choice for 23 violationslast month, including failing to tell authorities about suspected child abuse, sharing knowledge of suspected abuse with other employees and failing to follow the day care's own policies, state inspection records show. FSSA was first notified about the allegations by the Indiana Department of Child Services, not by the day care.
Former day care employee Ali Al-Awadi, 20, Indianapolis,
was charged last month with felony child molesting
in a case involving a 4-year-old girl at Children's Choice Learning Center, which is at St. Vincent Indianapolis Hospital, Marion Superior Court records show.
The girl told other caregivers at the day care that ""Mr. Ali"" had put his finger inside her during nap time, but they didn't report the girl's accusation to authorities until nearly 20 hours later, court records show.
Perry said the day care already had implemented a corrective action plan to ensure it is in full compliance with state law. She said the company plans to appeal the state's license revocation.
""Our new center leadership team intends to continue working closely with them to reverse this decision,"" Perry said.
Before the state's action, Children's Choice Learning Center had been listed as a level three in Paths to Quality, the second-highest level in a rating system used by the state to help parents identify quality child care programs.
The day care can remain open during its appeal.

Federal decriminalization hasn't happened yet, but that isn't holding back revenue growth, and investors might soon take notice
Cannabis companies are experiencing record revenue growth, but the stock prices for these companies aren't following in the same path. There's a dark force keeping share prices down, and it's not The Batman.
But one of these companies appears ready to lead the turnaround for investors while offering a strongly discounted share price after losing 64% of its value since its 52-week high.

Global turmoil is leading investors away from cannabis
Where there's smoke, there's fire. And there's been a lot of smoke around cannabis investmentsfor the past year. But Columbia Care
(
7.15%
)
stands out as one company that is ready to make a bull run once the smoke clears and the market stabilizes. Many of the fires being faced are not related directly to the cannabis market. The Biden administration promoted the decriminalization of cannabis but is spending its time, understandably, dealing with military conflicts, inflation, and supply chain constraints.
Those are all legitimate reasons to put cannabis decriminalization on the back burner. Unfortunately, investors are taking note, which is leading them away from cannabis as an investment, and more toward less risky and, in some cases, higher-dividend-paying companies.
Cannabis sales continue to grow year over year
Meanwhile, the cannabis market continues to flourish on a state-by-state basis. For example, Columbia Care is a multi-state operator (MSO) with growing operations spread across the U.S. and saw annual revenue increase 172% on a year-over-year basis as of March, helped along by a sequential quarterly growth rate of 29%. The annual growth rate is higher than 29 of 30 cannabis companies with quarterly revenue greater than $25 million, according to tracking data from New Cannabis Ventures. And its 29% quarterly growth is tops among all 30 of those companies. It doesn't get much better than that.
During the past year, Columbia Care has been extremely busy expanding its footprint, including opening its 80th dispensary in the U.S., entering the medical market in Missouri, rebranding its dispensaries across Florida, becoming the first cannabis operator to offer whole flower in New York, and becoming and the first company to manufacture cannabis extract vaporizer pens in the U.K.
Columbia Care ended the third quarter with a year-over-year quarterly gross profit increase of 205%, to $64 million, and enjoyed a gross margin of 49%, crushing the 26% and 27% gross margins of competitors Tilray, and Grow Generation, and in line with top revenue generating MSO Curaleaf Holdings.
But investors have gotten nervous around lowered guidance from the company for full-year 2021 revenue -- earnings release scheduled for March 25 -- which got slashed by 7% due to pricing pressures and softening retail sales in larger markets, including California, Colorado, and Florida, as well as some unanticipated regulatory delays impacting store openings in new markets. These negative comments led to the continued slide in Columbia Care's stock price. But they didn't deter analysts such as Pablo Zuanic of Cantor Fitzgerald, who kept an overweight rating on the stock and a $5.20 price target, which reflects a premium of 111% over the current price.
Rising revenue and falling stock prices give investors an opportunity
The revenue growth rate for the quarter and the year may be easily shrugged off by some investors if it were a company with a lower revenue total, but the $132 million for Q3 ranks Columbia Care eighth among public cannabis companies for total quarterly revenue. Fortunately for investors with a long-term approach -- which is kind of a must for cannabis investing -- the drop in stock price while revenue continues to grow opens the door to opportunity for a piece of a top 10 revenue-producing MSO at a discounted price. That opportunity could be escalated by a global cannabis market that is projected to grow to as much as $128 billion by 2028, supported by a 26% compound annual growth rate.
The company's growth going forward should be supported by an enlarged footprint extending into emerging markets including New Jersey, New York, and Virginia, which should help pad its revenue numbers as those states launch retail cannabis sales in the next two years. And if a new bill proposed in Virginia is passed, it could bring forward that state's 2024 launch up by 16 months, making Columbia Care a buy-now candidatewith the potential for a strong bull run.

A critical opportunity to behave as a world-class organization.
Whether they are resigning or being asked to leave, your ability to artfully navigate this transition can either have both parties walk away as fierce advocates, even allies, for life or lead to such fundamental resolution that the colleague offers to stay on board after all.
Scheduling
When someone is exiting the organization with goodwill, plan this interview for within 3 days of notice, ideally within one day.
When someone is exiting the organization when goodwill is not certain, plan this interview for within a week after leaving and handle the urgent legalities separately.
Exit Interviews are
not for right before they leave, half of the value possible is lost by then plus the last day is a time for toasts & handshakes/hugs.
State Context
My hope for this exit interview is to
Gain any valuable critique from your experience to help our organization grow.
Celebrate the contributions I hope weve made to each other.
Part ways as allies and speak candidly about how we can be supportive as you move forward in your career.
Get Their World
What are they moving towards? (Express happiness for their next chapter)
Anything they are moving away from? This is where you often elicit critiques of your company as well as the opportunity for them to vent a bit if needed. Prioritize asking clarifying questions, welcoming their perspectives even if/especially if you dont agree with them. Welcome any questions they might have as well.
Offer a summary of what you think youve heard from them.
Err on the side of zero unsolicited coaching at this phase of the relationship, even when done well its a favorite way to create defensiveness.
Share Impact
Include everything from Regret/Loss to Gratitude/Congratulations.
Inspired by new possibilities within the organization?
This is often the most effective place to attempt retaining the individual, stating how theyve inspired you to improve the organization might resolve the concern that had them wanting to leave.
Make/Confirm Plan
Are they offering two weeks? Will they train their replacement? Does it still feel like a charged situation in which they should simply turn-in their badge and leave?
Review non-competes, NDAs etc
Acknowledgment & Close
A highlight moment we had with you is
One way we are better off for having worked with you is
Allow them final words + compulsory handshake/fist bump/hug.
In summary, yes its unsettling to have someone you worked closely with expressing negativity publicly and in worst cases actually hinders recruiting efforts. The best exit interviews prevent those unsavory situations when they focus less on preventing something and more on sincerely celebrating and honoring the journey youve had with any and every employee who has dedicated some part of their professional journey to your cause.
The more you actually enjoy the interview, the more effective it is likely to be, so enjoy!

IIFCL
) is set to more than double its investments in bonds and investment trusts as new projects, such as roads, smaller ports and airports, are bid out for construction next fiscal.
The state-backed infrastructure financing company invested about Rs 1,000 crore in bonds and Rs 325 crore in infrastructure investment trusts (InvITs) so far this year for the first time.
We expect to see a quantum jump in our bond investments next fiscal year, said P R Jaishankar, managing director, India Infrastructure Finance Company (IIFCL). We are strategically working toward fine-tuning our business model that promotes focused investments in bonds and InvITs in addition to the existing product lines such as direct lending or takeout finance.
The Reserve Bank of India(
RBI
) permitted IIFCL to invest in bonds and infrastructure trusts in October last year. Accordingly, IIFCL has begun to invest in those instruments from January this year.
So far, it did not invest beyond the triple-A category, the top grade. During 2022-23, the company expects bond investments to at least double. IIFCL can invest in the coming years in bonds rated above AA.
Jaishankar declined to comment on individual investment plans.
Corporation formed the largest chunk in the bond portfolio, at Rs 500 crore, with PNC Infratechobtaining about Rs 150 crore in subscriptions from the infra financing giant.
IIFCL also invested Rs 325 crore in the bonds sold by KKR-controlled InvIT Virescent Renewable Energy Trust.
We are seeking to promote very long term bonds in line with global standards, said Jaishankar.
Earlier, the company used to lend directly to projects via loans. The organisation will continue to be engaged in credit enhancement, which is a cushioning factor that helps special purpose vehicles to improve credit ratings of a project, thereby promoting access to the bond market.
IIFCL aims to emerge as a credible long-term institutional debt investor, in addition to Employees Provident Fund Organisation (EPFO) or LIC of India. Although it has a long way to go to match the mammoth corpus of those two top domestic institutional investors, it has made a beginning as a dedicated investor for a capital-starved country that has a huge infrastructure funding requirements.
IIFCL began to invest in different infra bonds, which in turn makes space for borrowers and helps in market making, said a senior debt market executive at a private bank.
The state-backed organisation has an outstanding borrowing of about Rs 38,000 crore, of which, it tapped around 41 percent funding from multilateral or supranational institutions, and around 50 percent through domestic bonds.
Banks, according to Jaishankar, are good at assessing greenfield projects. So they can fund them until a project is commissioned.
Thereafter, the funding can be raised through bonds, where we can invest, he said.

377,The Least & Most Stressful Cities in 2021 According to this Report,"BellaNaija.com
The CBD and well-being company VAAY.comhas launched research that rates cities according to how stressful their settings are for their residents. The firm chose to investigate prevalent exterior elements that make city living difficult for urbanites as part of its aim to encourage inner balance and mindfulness.
During this process, VAAY discovered that it could analyze numerous stress indicators among cities around the world to identify which cities are the least and most stressful for their residents. The resulting index shines a light on the ever-present factors that influence a persons stress levels and gives insight into which global cities perform best in different areas and can be an example for their peers.
Our objective with this study is to show what cities can achieve for their citizens through effective governance, robust environmental policies and well-resourced social welfare systems. The aim is not to single out the cities which may lag in any of these areas, but rather highlight those which are leading examples of what can be done to improve the wellbeing of their inhabitants, comments Finn Age Hnsel, co-founder of VAAY.
We hope that the results of the study serve as a useful barometer for cities and citizens alike to reassess their environments and work together towards developing cities that are less stressful places to live.
How the study was conducted:
To begin the study, VAAY considered which macro factors contribute to stress, narrowing them down to four broad categories. Next, over 500 global cities were assessed against several stress indicators in these categories, before those without reliable data were removed, leaving a final line-up of 100 cities.
The study started with factors related to governance assessing safety and security, and socio-political stability as indicators of how comfortable someone can feel in a city. To include stress indicators for all segments of society, levels of gender and minority equality were also scrutinised, as these demographics often have a higher chance of experiencing stress due to societal frameworks shaped by local laws and policy decisions.
Following this, VAAY compared how stressful each citys urban environment is by looking at population density statistics in addition to air, light, and noise pollution levels, the amount of traffic congestion and weather conditions. These indicators were included to capture the stress-inducing effect of atmospheric contamination and extreme weather conditions, for example, wildfires, heatwaves, and periods of extended darkness, which are strongly associated with both physical and mental health conditions.
Next, several financial factors were evaluated, including unemployment rates, social security structures and local purchasing power. These indicators were included to reflect that economic problems are a cause of significant stress for many people, and have become increasingly widespread since the beginning of the pandemic.
The quality and accessibility of healthcare in each city was then compiled, as well as the availability of mental healthcare. Finally, a Covid Response Stress Impact score was generated by looking at how stressful each governments pandemic response was for its population, as well as how successful it was. The study reveals which cities have the most stressful environments for their citizens, and which lead by example as the least stressful cities.

Joe Whitt, COO, Synchrony Pharmacy
Long-term care provider PCA Pharmacy will change its name to Synchrony Pharmacy on Jan. 1, 2022, the company announced Friday.
The rebranding is part of a strategy to align with its parent brand, Synchrony Health Services, it said. The two brands are ancillary companies under the umbrella of long-term care giant Trilogy Health Services.
The change is in name only, the pharmacy provider added. Synchrony Pharmacy will continue to partner with skilled nursing, assisted living and other healthcare facilities to meet the needs of residents through specialized clinical operations support services, it said.
Prior to the name change, the company had expanded its services to include mail order pharmacy. It also has near-term plans to add laboratory and portable diagnostic imaging to its offerings, it said.
This is an exciting step to align with our industry-leading partners within the Synchrony Health Services brand, Joe Whitt, chief operating officer, said. It provides us a more strategic approach to providing unrivaled health care services to the patients, residents and caregivers we serve throughout the post-acute continuum of care.
In April, spurred by the pandemic, Trilogy began offering its approximately 17,000 employees and their dependents a one-source, full-service discount pharmacy benefit through the pharmacy.

380,Jewelry Market Must Prepare For A Steep Drop But Signet Jewelers Is Ready,"Costco Addresses Supply Chain Pains By Chartering Their Own Ships
What goes up must come down
As much as the industry might hope that jewelry sales continue to grow at its current heady pace, history and common sense argue otherwise.
Since 2014, jewelry consumption advanced from $59.1 billion to $62.3 billion in 2020, some 5%, and jewelry retailer sales grew from $31.1 billion to $33.3 billion, a 7% increase.
2014 was a pivotal year because that is when the jewelry market recovered all that it lost in the Great Recession. It took seven long years for jewelry consumption and jewelry retailer sales to exceed levels reached in 2017.
Now with inflation running at a 40-year high, consumers are getting squeezed in all the essential areas, like food, gas, utilities and housing. That leaves less for discretionary spending and jewelry is one of the most discretionary of purchases.
While economists argue about whether a recession is imminent it certainly looks like the jewelry market will undergo a course correction. How far it falls and how long it lasts is anybodys guess.
But jewelry consumption did pretty well for seven years through 2020 and it took seven years for the jewelry market to recover after 2007 seven years feast, seven years famine history is likely to repeat itself.
If change is coming and it surely will, then Signet Jewelers would seem to have the most to lose, being ranked the nations number one jewelry retailer on the
National Jewelers Superseller list It operates some 2,800 retail locations under its Kay, Zales, Jared, Diamonds Direct and Banter by Pierce Pagoda banners, plus DTC James Allen and Rocksbox jewelry rental, and more.
But just like the biblical Joseph in Egypt, CEO Gina Drosos and her team have been preparing for this moment.
Ready for whatever the future holds
Since 2018 the company has been undergoing a transformation. Phase one in its transformation plan, Path to Brilliance, was completed in fiscal 2022 ended December 31, 2021, and now its embarked on phase two Inspiring Brilliance with the goal to achieve $9 billion in sales.
To date, its reached $7.8 billion in revenues, just $1.2 billion shy of that goal, and its racked up $1.6 billion in sales over the past two years.
While Drosos predicts the jewelry industry will be down low-single digits to basically flat this year surely she is comparing results to 2020, not the 2021 outlier year the company is guiding to reach $8.03 billion to $8.25 billion in sales this year. There is every reason to believe that will be achieved.
We are demonstrating that Signet has the strategies, strength and structural advantages to consistently outpace the market and gain share while also delivering sustainable double-digit margins, Drosos said in the earning call
Heres what she is talking about:
Scale means growth
Throughout the earnings call, Drosos refers to scale frequently. Its capitalizing on its scale at retail, with each of its banners now clearly differentiated thanks to the Brilliance plan.
Much of the credit for its banner differentiation has come through a significant investment in targeted marketing, including a $180 million increase in advertising in the past year. That enabled more targeted digital advertising and gave it a 50% share of voice in television.
This enables us to increase customer acquisition and engaging customers with relevant messages in the right channels at the right times, Drosos explained. Customers who are responding to our marketing have higher purchase intent and are looking to spend more.
In North America, average transaction value was up more than 15% and in-store conversion up nearly 20% compared to two years ago. It grew its number of new customers by nearly one-third over fiscal 2021 and brought back 37% of customers whod lapsed more than two years.
Signet is also making the most of its scale through vertical integration of its supply chain, a major competitive advantage in the current environment with industry supply chains challenged. It also gives Signet more control of prices points. It can value engineer product design for a range of good, better, best product offerings.
And scale is enhanced through its enhanced data analytics capabilities. It has a fully integrated inventory management system across the entire company and insights necessary to optimize its retail footprint. Over the last four years, it reduced its retail fleet by 20%. And thanks to its efforts to differentiate its banners, a Kay and Zales stores can sit side-by-side and not cannibalize sales as they once did.
Deeper customer connections
Its digital e-commerce portal is leading to deeper levels of customer engagement. Approximately 65% of customers start their customer journey digitally. And some 90% of its high-value customers, who spend in excess of $500, engage across its different shopping channels.
While most customer transactions are completed in store 80% versus 20% via e-commerce Drosos explained that the strategic importance of its digital platform is measured in more than just sales.
It's really one of the competitive advantages that I think is least understood about Signet but probably most valuable because the level of spend and the level of capability that we have put into this over the last several years is just something that is unmatched in a fragmented category, she said.
What matters is how customers are shopping, how are we acquiring them and how are they moving through our purchase funnel, she added.
Giving customers more of what they need
When times get tough, discretionary purchases, like jewelry, are the first place that consumers cut. During the 2008/2009 recession, spending on jewelry dropped 14% from its 2007 high to its 2009 low.
But Signet, more than other jewelry companies, is shielded from that by having more of what consumers need when it comes to jewelry.
For most couples getting married, bridal jewelry is not a discretionary purchase but a must-have. This puts Signet is good stead where it claims 30% market share.
This year will be a boom time for the wedding business. Some 2.5 million weddings will take place in 2022, more than seen since 1984, and up 16% since 2019, according to the
Wedding Report
And attending weddings yields a compounding effect on future wedding statistics. Dating couples who attend a wedding are the most likely to get engaged shortly afterward. So more weddings means more new couples getting married and more bridal jewelry sales down the road.
Providing jewelry accessories for the bridal party and mothers of the bride and groom is another big opportunity for Signet this year. And it is a testing the concept of bridal subscription jewelry through its Rocksbox banner, giving bridal party members the chance to wear much more expensive jewelry than they could naturally afford for the wedding photos.
Besides bridal, Signet is also leaning into more jewelry repair and extended service agreements. With the goal of making this a $1 billion business, Signet grew s",Ready,company description,executive statement,,,
386,Beauty professionals network ZibaHub launches Inclusive Beauty,"Beauty professional network ZibaHub
launched a consumer facing portion of its app to help people find beauty and wellness pros with specific expertise and focuses on inclusion.
Called Inclusive Beauty this section of the startups namesake app aims to link consumers with professionals who can help them or share their values. It also helps the pros find customers and recover bookings lost during this pandemic year.
We did a survey and found that 80 percent of beauty professionals made less than 50% than what they made this time last year, said co-founder and CEO Mandana Salehi-Stewart
At first, her team thought the drop in customers was due to economics, as people didnt have the money to spend. However, Salehi-Stewarts mother, an esthetician, told her daughter that many of her customers are older women who were scared of possible Covid-19 exposure.
Its a story Salehi-Stewart started to hear from other professionals on the app.
The startup already attracted about 1,400 Portland-area beauty and wellness professionals on its app. Those professionals used the app as a hub to post jobs, find events, highlight skills and products and generally create a professional network.
The startup created different badges that professionals can add to their profiles that consumers can filter. Badges indicate expertise with textured hair, hijab-friendly environments with modesty protocols and mental health awareness, among other selling points and skills.
There is also a section for professionals to highlight their Covid-19 safety protocols.
Beauty professionals understand that 'feeling safe' means more to their customers than simply providing an environment that follows health codes and regulations. It means crafting a comforting experience that welcomes and supports the whole customer based on their personal and social choices, as well,"" said Salehi-Stewart.
The consumer app wants to help beauty professionals answer two big questions consumers have when seeking services: Does someone in this establishment have the skills and tools to meet my needs? And am I welcome here, she said.
ZibaHub, an alum of the Portland Incubator Experiment, launched last year. At the time, Salehi-Stewart hoped to get 300 professionals using the app. The startup ended up attracting 1,400 users.
That overwhelmed the simple MVP that the team created. However, they nurtured a solid community of users as they rebuilt the app this year.
Coming into 2020, Salehi-Stewart was preparing to fundraise. She opened her round in February and was in due diligence with investors when the pandemic struck. By March, those investors were telling her that the references and user feedback were great, but that no one was investing at the time.
She didnt raise any money and instead got creative on how to rebuild the app. She brought on developers and others working for equity who finished the work.
She is unsure if she'll again try to raise money but is working to monetize the platform through premium job postings and brand partnerships.
Despite the challenges of the year, Salehi-Stewart remains optimistic, noting that community professionals created around ZibaHub stepped up in 2020. Members, many of whom use the same personal protective equipment as medical professionals, donated 20,000 items to hospitals during the company's spring PPE drive.
Salehi-Steward said the changes ZibaHub made were not unexpected.
This was on the roadmap, she said of adding the consumer facing product. The map we had last year when we launched, this was in year five. And we had a lot more planned for year two. But what Covid did was it flipped our roadmap.

388,Anthony Mays leaves Google to help tackle diversity in tech,"WATCH LIVE
Key Points
An influential software engineer within Google, Anthony Mays left the company after eight years to pursue his own diversity and inclusion consulting firm.
Mays said his next steps include addressing distrust minorities have with tech.
Using his experience at Google, Mays says he is hoping to bring others in the door by giving accessible tips, one-on-one mentorship and interview help.
Popular Google software engineer Anthony D. Mays leaves the search giant to pursue diversity and inclusion full-time.
Anthony D. Mays
The year after Anthony D. Mays joined Googleas a software engineer in 2013, the company publicly released its diversity numbers for the first time. He knew the numbers were likely low, but he didn't realize just how low.
When he found out only 1% of technology roles included Black people, Mays made it his personal mission to help grow that number while working at Google. Now, after several years of seeing slow-moving progress within Google and the tech industry at large, Mays is branching out on his own, starting a consulting firm that aims to help both companies and employees reach more representation.
A key voice for DEI at Google
When Mays joined Google in 2013, he received a personal welcome call from the company's human resources chief at the time, Lazlo Bock. ""That was pretty special,"" Mays told CNBC in an interview.
The following year, the company became the first of many to release their diversity numbers, which showed a dismal 2% of full-time Google employees were Black and only 1% of technical roles were filled by Black employees. Shocked by the statistics, Mays felt a personal obligation to help those numbers grow.
To do that, began sharing his story of coming from an abusive home in Compton, California.
""Having come from the world of Compton to the world of Google and Silicon Valley for several years, it allows me the unique opportunity to build bridges in the way that others may not be able to.""
He first shared his story in a company email that ended up going viral. Then, in 2018, he shared his experiences in a Buzzfeed videocalled ""My Unlikely Path To Becoming The 1% At Google,"" which has racked up 5.3 million views. He also wrote an article with Google's public relations team, he said, for Huffington Post called ""Google Would Never Hire a Person Like Me,"" explaining how his environment and self-doubt almost kept him from applying for a job at Google.
""I was getting emails from people in and outside of the company that I'd never met,"" Mays said, adding that he was humbled by the response.
Mays, a full-time engineer at Google, was a key voice for company diversity in tech. Now, he wants to use what he's learned to increase representation.
Anthony Mays
Many told Mays he inspired them and made them feel seen and heard, he said. Google recruiters told him his coaching work helped get diverse applicants in the door and succeed during interviews, he said.
But becoming a key voice for DEI also came with setbacks: He had to juggle DEI work with being a full-time software engineer and says he sacrificed promotions due to the time spent on those initiatives.
Mays said he also experienced imposter syndrome.
""People were telling me I'm doing well, but I'm also keenly aware that in some people's minds, I'm the diversity hire,"" he said of is feelings early on. ""So, early on, there was this sneaking suspicion that I have that I'm being treated differently because I'm a Black man working in tech. ""
Part of the motivation for continuing his work, he explained, was ""survivors' guilt,"" Mays said.
""I had a number of friends who were shot and killed when they were 18 and 19 years old,"" he said. ""When you see that kind of tragedy and be so close to it, you start asking what made me so different that I deserved to escape and they didn't?""
But most of the motivation, he said, came from his faith and hope for equity among underrepresented workers. He said he feels a responsibility and passion for giving people a chance at more opportunities.
Mays, whose authentic communication and candor draw people, says he tries to be honest when asked what it's like to be a Black man at Google.
""I talk about how I had a good experience, but there are no guarantees, and I want us to be honest about that,"" he said. ""There are people who've had horrible experiences, and I want to remind people that as much as I've enjoyed being at Google, things might go differently for you.""
He also acknowledges the challenges he sees companies face when trying to implement new programs dedicated to diversity and inclusion. At Google, he said, he saw impactful diversity and inclusion programs that were either put on hold or changed in different direction.
""I don't know many companies who are working harder than Google to effect change; however, one of the problems I've seen is the sustained commitment in any given direction,"" Mays said. ""What tends to happen is you have a program that works well for a year or two and then inexplicably goes into another direction or there's a shuffle or a reorg and it can be hard to see things through for the sustained long term.""
'The real moonshot'
As the years went on, Mays found his personal brand deviating from Google's, he said.
""Google's an advertising company that organizes information of the world, and my focus during my time there was helping with that as a software engineer  that's what I was hired to do,"" he said. ""But, I began to find my interest more in organizing information for the underrepresented in tech who struggled to find resources and information on how to navigate tech as an industry.""
In late 2021, Mays says he saw a window of opportunity to do DEI work full-time after watching the labor market tighten, record resignations and tech job-seekers looking for better financial security and work-life flexibility amid the Covid-19 pandemic.
""Seeing the need and the response to my own story over these past few years, it became well 'ok, now I want to do this more than just on my off-time,"" Mays said. ""I came to the realization that now really is the time and as the pandemic begins to loosen its hold.""
Mays' last day was in mid-February, and in less than a week, he used his savings to launch Morgan Latimer Consulting which is named after African American inventors Garrett A. Morgan and Lewis H. Latimer.
Mays has two main goals: to help underrepresented people get jobs in tech if they want them and to help companies understand how to get and keep those workers.
An influential software engineer within Google, Anthony Mays left the company after eight years to pursue his own diversity and inclusion consulting firm.

Working with companies, Mays has had to explain the business importance of DEI, which studies have for years shown improves business outcomes and product development.

397,A Total Disaster: Crypto Firms Face Being Booted From the UK as a Key Deadline Approaches  NBC4 Washington,"Updated 48 mins ago
Matt Cardy | Getty Images
From Mar. 31, firms operating crypto services in Britain must be registered with the Financial Conduct Authority.
Revolut and Copper are among the companies listed on a temporary FCA register, which will close once the deadline passes.
They may soon be forced to wind down their crypto activities in Britain if they fail to obtain full authorization.
LONDON  A slew of cryptocurrency companies could be forced to wind down their business in the U.K. if they fail to register with the finance watchdog ahead of a key deadline next week.
From Mar. 31, firms operating crypto services in Britain must be registered with the Financial Conduct Authority, which is tasked with overseeing how digital asset firms combat money laundering.
Last year, the regulator extended the deadline allowing firms on a temporary register to continue trading while they sought full authorization  it'll close once the deadline passes. The FCA said many crypto companies had withdrawn their applications as they were not meeting the required anti-money laundering standards.
Stay informed about local news and weather in the D.C. area. Get the NBC4 Washington app for iOS or Android and pick your alerts.
Now, with just days to go until the new deadline elapses, the fate of firms on the temporary register  including $33 billion fintech firm Revolut and Copper, a crypto start-up that counts former U.K. Finance Minister Philip Hammond as an advisor  hangs in the balance.
'A total disaster'
Many industry insiders have expressed frustration with the FCA's handling of the crypto register.
Money Report
Alaska Airlines to Convert 2 More Boeing Jets Into Freighters in Bet on Air Cargo Boom
One lawyer advising crypto companies on their applications said the regulator had been slow to approve applications and was often unresponsive, a sentiment echoed by other figures in the sector.
""The process has been a total disaster from the FCA's side of things,"" the lawyer told CNBC, speaking on the condition of anonymity due to the sensitive nature of the matter.
An FCA spokesperson said it has approved just 33 crypto firms' applications so far. More than 80% of the firms it has assessed to date have either withdrawn their applications or been rejected.
""We've seen a high number of the cryptoasset businesses applying for registration not meeting standards there to help ensure firms are not used to transfer and or disguise criminal funds,"" the spokesperson said.
""Firms that do not meet the expected benchmark can withdraw their application. Firms that decide not to withdraw have the right to appeal our decision to refuse, including through the courts.""
Why it matters
Gemini, the crypto exchange operated by Tyler and Cameron Winklevoss, was among the first firms to get approved by the FCA.
Blair Halliday, Gemini's head of U.K., said the licensing regime is important as it provides customers the assurance that they're dealing with a firm that has undergone rigorous scrutiny.
""Getting a crypto asset registration in place was a critical step for crypto in this country,"" Halliday told CNBC. ""It gave firms that really have that desire to seek regulatory approvals something to demonstrate as a key differentiator.""
Crypto industry association Global Digital Finance's Lavan Thasarathakumar said there has been ""a lot of frustration"" over the process.
""Fundamentally, it has been too slow,"" Thasarathakumar said, adding that the FCA has been dealing with a ""huge backlog"" of applications for the register.
And some companies are still withdrawing their applications.
That includes B2C2, the London-based crypto trading firm, which recently withdrew from the FCA's temporary register. Since Monday, all of B2C2's spot trading activity has shifted to the company's U.S. entity. The firm said its derivatives business is unaffected as it is handled by an FCA-authorized subsidiary.
""We are committed to ensuring this move causes as little disruption as possible and are working closely with our clients to ensure they continue to have a seamless trading experience with us,"" a B2C2 spokeswoman told CNBC via Telegram.
Firms that have had their applications rejected by the FCA can appeal, but the process is a long one and could need to go through the courts.
A tribunal recently sided with the FCA's decision to refuse an application from the crypto exchange Gidiplus.
Brexit dividend?
Mauricio Magaldi, global strategy director for crypto at the fintech consultancy 11:FS, said the current regulatory direction of the U.K. puts the country at risk of falling behind the U.S., European Union and other regions.
President Joe Biden has signed an executive order calling for coordination from the government on oversight of digital currencies, while EU lawmakers recently voted down a proposal that would have effectively banned bitcoin mining in the bloc.
""While major jurisdictions are spotting the opportunity and the risk, the U.K. is emphasising the risk,"" Magaldi told CNBC. ""By moving too fast and too narrow, rules and timeframes create hurdles to crypto firms that could potentially displace them from the U.K. market.""
Industry representatives fear this could put the U.K. at a disadvantage at a time when it is vying to be a global leader in financial innovation post-Brexit. The country is home to a thriving fintech industry, attracting nearly $12 billion in investment last year.
But fast-growing fintechs like Revolut and Copper may soon be forced to wind down their crypto activities in Britain and move offshore if they don't make it onto the full register. Both companies declined to comment when contacted by CNBC.
Firms like PayPal and Coinbase, which sell crypto services in the U.K. through overseas subsidiaries, will be unaffected.

Editor's note: Find the latest COVID-19 news and guidance in Medscape's Coronavirus Resource Center
The Chief Executive Officer of a high-volume national nurse staffing firm based in Overland Park, Kansas, has stepped down after questions were raised about his support of an antimask group reportedly started by his 19-year-old son.
Brian Cleary had been CEO of Krucial Staffing for the past 2 years. The company advertises on its websitethat it is the nation's ""leader in emergency management and high volume healthcare staffing in the United States."" It helps fill nursing gaps in hospitals hard hit by COVID-19 and other areas hit by disasters.
Kansas City's National Public Radio affiliate KCUR reportedthat Cleary's son, Jacob Cleary, 19, started an antimasking group in Johnson County called Mask Choice 4 Kids As of Tuesday, its Facebook page appeared to have more than 5100 followers.
The group has urged children to resist school mask mandates and has sold T-shirts and other merchandise to promote its message.
KCUR reported that Jacob's father, a registered nurse, supports the group's mission. It reported that in a recent post on the group's Facebook page Brian Cleary wrote: ""Hey guys, new to the group here. My 19 year old son had the idea of mask choice for kids, then a bunch of parents have run with it. Follow us on social media, we are going to be having a rally outside at the next board meeting. Monday September 13
th
from 5-630 pm. Got to have big numbers, we are shooting for 500-1000. Bring kids neighbors, everyone! Strength in numbers."" 
Jacob Cleary posted on Facebook on September 7 that he is now attending college at the University of Colorado in Denver, and the group's new spokesperson is Tana Goertz, who competed on Donald Trump's ""Celebrity Apprentice"" and includes on her LinkedIn profilethat she is a ""personal friend"" of the former president.
The group posted a video of the Monday evening rally, where Goertz was the featured speaker, on its Facebook page. She stood next to a lawn sign featuring a mask with an X through it.
""Playing Both Sides""
A media representative from Krucial Staffing shared with Medscape Medical News its statement issued on Friday: ""In light of events outside our business, Krucial Staffing has accepted the resignation of Brian Cleary. We want to thank Brian for his contributions to our company. Since this is a personnel decision, we have nothing further to say regarding this matter.
""Obviously being in the healthcare staffing business, we understand the importance of masks in hospitals and any medical setting. As a company we work to ensure that all our healthcare personnel have the best protective equipment to keep them safe in their working environment.""
An editorialin the Kansas City Star said Cleary gave ""the appearance of playing both sides"" in the war against COVID-19.
The Star editorial board highlighted that Krucial job postings offer $125 per hour, with overtime of $187 for registered nurses who travel to help struggling hospitals in Texas and elsewhere.""
Brian Cleary's LinkedIn profilelists his current employment as CEO at Engineer Staffing Now, LLC. His contact information, however, points to Favorite Healthcare Staffing, where he previously worked for 21 years.
KCUR reports that Favorite Healthcare Staffing lists its headquarters in the same office complex in Overland Park as Krucial Staffing.
""It's unclear if and how the two companies are related,"" KCUR reports.
Attempts to reach Cleary for comment were not successful.

416,Danone North America Shares Insights from One of the Largest Studies on Multicultural Consumers and their Relationship with Plant-Based Food & Beverage,",
Dec. 8, 2021
/PRNewswire-HISPANIC PR WIRE/ -- Danone North America, a purpose-driven company and a category leader in plant-based food and beverages with brands such as Silk and So Delicious, today released new research exploring the relationship between multicultural audiences and plant-based products. Understanding that food plays a defining role in multicultural consumers' lives and is seen as a form of self-expression, Danone North America embarked on this research to learn from different multicultural communities about their interest in plant-based eating, how younger generations are adopting flexitarian lifestyles, what cultural stigmas they may experience, and how the industry can better reflect their culture in everything from marketing to innovation.
At the Table: The Multicultural Plant-Based Food Perspective, a survey of more than 4,000 adults in the U.S. including Asian Americans, Black/African Americans, and Hispanic/Latino communities, found that plant-based eating is on the rise among multicultural audiences, especially the younger millennial and Gen-Z populations. While the popularity of plant-based foods has exploded and multicultural audiences are a driving contributing force to the movement, this research also uncovered gaps in how much multicultural consumers can truly embrace plant-based diets as they feel that plant-based offerings are less attainable due to cultural stigmas and accessibility barriers.
""Plant-based eating has the potential to be a real beacon of healthy living, especially for diverse communities. To hear that multicultural audiences are more willing to add plant-based foods into their diets was personally inspiring and affirming to me, as my family and many friends have adopted flexitarian lifestyles over the last few years. With this research and the breadth of our product portfolio, the ability to help move Danone North America and the plant-based industry forward is one of the biggest reasons why I joined the company,"" said
John Starkey
, President of Plant-Based Food & Beverage for Danone North America, ""We've made a conscious effort to be more inclusive and reach underrepresented communities, particularly through our Silk and So Delicious brands, which have a long legacy in the plant-based space. Yet, there is still a lot of work to be done in understanding how different communities are experiencing plant-based food and beverages and how we can do more to engage and appeal to multicultural consumers, from our innovation choices and marketing efforts to our community impact work and sustainability strategies.""
Key findings and statistics from Danone North America's At the Table: The Multicultural Plant-Based Food Perspective:
Multicultural Consumers Play a Significant Role in Driving the Plant-Based Movement
Multicultural audiences are more willing than the total population to add plant-based foods into their diets as a substitution for animal products, with younger millennials and Gen Z consumers leading the charge.
71% of Asian Americans, 55% of Black/African Americans and 61% of Hispanic/Latino respondents say they ""strongly"" or ""somewhat agree"" that they are open to substituting the current foods they eat with plant-based alternatives compared to less than half of total population respondents (49%).
Nearly 9 out 10 (84%) multicultural respondents say food is a form of self-expression, compared to 79% of Total Population. (Breakdown: 82% Hispanic/Latino, 80% Black/African American, and 91% Asian American.)
Nearly three quarters of multicultural respondents (73%) say they 'strongly or somewhat agree' that they try to be environmentally friendly with their food choices but sometimes don't have the information they need.
Multicultural Audiences Report Multiple Barriers to Plant-Based Adoption
While multicultural audiences are making up an increasing share of the plant-based market, research revealed that overall, they feel less represented and less engaged by plant-based food brands.
More than half of (55%) respondents say their community and culture are ""not that well"" or ""not at all"" represented by plant-based food companies and brands including 58% of Hispanic/Latino, 52% of Asian Americans, and 60% African American/Black respondents. The numbers are even higher among in the Gen-X and Baby Boomer generations within these communities.
More than half of Hispanic/Latino (56%) and Black/African American (51%) respondents ""strongly"" or ""somewhat agree"" there is a stigma in their culture around people who eat plant-based foods.
Multicultural respondents feel some healthier or more nutritious foods are less attainable due to barriers of affordability and accessibility. 48% of Asian Americans, 42% of Hispanic/Latino and 40% Black/African Americans also say they see plant-based foods as more expensive.
At the Table: The Multicultural Plant-Based Food Perspective further highlighted that multicultural audiences believe plant-based eating is healthy and nutritious, better for the environment, and more ethical. Multicultural consumers are looking for more plant-based companies and brands to engage with in a deeper and more meaningful way, not only through marketing efforts, but also through ingredient choices, education, and sustainability work.
Danone North America is committed to listening to and learning from multicultural consumers, and it shares this research with the industry in hopes of driving more inclusivity for this growing audience within the plant-based category. Armed with this research, Danone North America seeks to continue to understand the core values and drivers for multicultural consumers to inspire more meaningful relationships. Moving into 2022, the company is looking to take further action, expanding its inclusive marketing and customer efforts through new internal and external partnerships which range from sales and marketing to nutrition, innovation and more.
""At Danone North America, we believe making progress toward a more inclusive, just, and diverse culture is an essential part of using our business as a force for good. Our commitments to Inclusive Diversity are put into action through a strategy that focuses on four major areas our people, the marketplace, community engagement and advocacy, for a number of topics that demonstrate our support for racial equity and social justice,"" said
Terrance Irizarry
, Head of Inclusive Diversity for Danone North America. ""Marketing efforts for our portfolio should reflect the diversity of our consumers and societyand also reach those consumers meaningfully. Conducting this important research on behalf of our plant-based portfolio is a huge step forward in listening, learning and ultimately taking action. It's also part of our larger journey and work toward enhancing the overall diversity in our content and our partnerships with diverse suppliers in the industry.""
While the company continues to learn and refine its efforts of inclusivity, Danone North America is proud of the initiatives it has taken to meaning",Danone North America,new initiatives & programs,,,,

431,Techno Creatives is the only Swedish company in the global UX Design Awards,"Written by
Fernanda Schimuneck
Gothenburg, July 2020 - THE Techno Creatives is the only Swedish company to be recognized in the UX Design Award nomination (UXDA20), a global competition for user and customer experience organized by the International Design Center Berlin (IDZ). Among 102 projects from 34 countries, the company received three nominations by its collaboration with the auto tech Veoneer, the science center, and museum Universeum, and the hybrid surf watch Weret.
This years nominated solutions cover a diverse range of fields of application, such as healthcare, mobility, communications, media, arts and entertainment, IoT, finance, agriculture, industry, and education. The UXDA comprises three competition categories: Product and Concept for the professional sector - which The Techno Creatives appears in both - and the New Talent Award for young designers.
The list of UXDA former winners is read like a who-is-who of the design industry and nominations are also seen as an outstanding accomplishment. So we are thrilled to put Swedish-based design and entrepreneurship on the global map, says the The Techno Creatives co-founder Emma Rozada.
Veoneer - Collaborative driving is a new vision Veoneer takes as the first step to fully autonomous vehicles on the road. The prototype released last January at CES 2020 aimed to educate the general public about autonomous vehicles and gather data and insights to improve the next generation of autonomous vehicle research development.
The project selected by UXDA20 in the Concept category included two types of demonstrations: indoor tent, where data insights contributed to a safer and better driver experience, and in-car demo apps for visitors to experience futuristic car features.
In this scenario, in-cabin sensors develop personal driver profiles and allow us to understand driver behavior better. Collaborative driving determines when drivers need safety assist technologies to take over, and when drivers want or need to take control. It also leverages communications between vehicles for a safer driving experience: vehicles can share thermal imaging to enable vehicles to share vision & better perceive its surroundings in challenging contexts & surroundings.
Weret - Also in the category Product, the TCC has been nominated for its production of their venture Weret - the worlds first connected watch specifically for surfers, just released in the market. The timepiece has pioneered the way to stay up to date with weather and surf conditions by showing real-time surf data with just a glance on the wrist. And this glance is on an analog interface, which makes the watch even more unique.
This way, the watch gives the possibility to have on hand data from two themes: Wave, that shows swell height and direction, and Wind, that brings up wind speed and wind direction, both powered by magicseaweed. For extra information such as air temperature and tide flow, all that needs to be done is to press the crown of the watch, and it goes from Time Mode to Weather Mode. Weret watches hit the market in May, and are available to purchase online at weret.com.
Our watch focuses on surfing enthusiasts, whether they are passionate amateurs or top-notch professionals. We aimed to create something exceptional and not just another activity tracker. Thats why we engaged surfers in product development. So, to already be nominated for a UX Design award in 2020 is an honor and also a sign that we are moving in the right direction, says Werets founder and designer, Joel Rozada.
Universeum - One of the projects recognized in the category Product is The Moonlander with Universeum. The installation simulates the landing process of Apollo 11 in a replicate cabin, giving the sense of space and making the experience close to reality. The Moonlander was designed to educate the public about scientific facts behind the spaceflights landing process that first landed humans on the Moon.
As the target group took special consideration to school kids and family, the simulator was built with two essential controls to simplify the landing experience: the boost button to both initiate the lending process, and the joystick to steer the orientation of the Moonlander so it could land in the right direction on the Moons surface. This experience is currently part of the space section exhibition at Universeum, in Gothenburg.
According to the UXDA20 organization, the jury of renowned experts will proceed to select winners later on this year. Due to the Covid-19 pandemic, the award ceremony will happen virtually, and all nominated solutions will present to the public in an online exhibition.",Universeum,product launching & presentation,participation in an event,,,

Step aside Apple and Google, Nvidia may be the new king of tech, one analyst contends.
""Nvidia may be the most technology company today,"" said Evercore ISI analyst C.J. Muse in a new note on Monday. The analyst reiterated an Outperform rating on Nvidia with a $375 price target.
Shares of Nvidia rose slightly in afternoon trading Monday to $277
Muse's upbeat take on Nvidia comes hot on the heels of the company's closely watched analyst day, where it held nearly 1,000 sessions that included more than 1,600 speakers.
""Beyond having best-in class hardware accelerator solutions with its GPUs, Nvidia is broadening its portfolio and deepening its expertise across DPUs and CPUs, along with other areas such as connectivity and interconnects to put all of the pieces together. Then to ensure these complex solutions run seamlessly, Nvidia is continuing to pioneer software both at the foundational level and application specific level which is key to the companys TAM [total addressable market] expansion and the overall democratization of AI. Events like GTC hammer these point home, with various customers and ecosystem partners highlighting the advancements they are driving along with NVDA, and clear roadmaps for continued growth for the next decade plus,"" Muse explained.
One area Nvidia is doubling down on is its autonomous driving platform.

Automotive will surely be our next multibillion-dollar business, Huang told Julie Hyman and Dan Howley in a Yahoo Finance Presentsinterview. The $11 billion is going to be quite a significant business for us just in the car. But if you look at the totality of AV, I think this is going to be one of the largest AI industries in the world.
During the conference, Nvidia put the potential market for auto-related software, hardware and data-center services at $300 billion.

Keep an eye out and you might see products on store shelves from a women's reproductive health startup founded in Charleston in 2019.
Natalist, which sells everything from pregnancy and ovulation tests to prenatal supplements, is looking to put a modern spin on the age-old issues of pregnancy and infertility.
The firm began in Charleston in 2019 by offering mostly subscription-based bundles of its products for purchase online. The major big-box store Target gave Natalist a shot in a limited number of stores in 2020, and now the company says its goods are available in Targets in every state, pharmacy giant Rite-Aid and grocers Albertsons, Safeway and Shaws.
Vitamins are just some of the items offered by Charleston-based Natalist. Natalist/Provided
It was important to get the products stocked in places where women normally go, said Vernita Brown, CEO of Natalist.
""Our company was really founded because of a lack of millennial-friendly products on the market,"" Brown said. ""When you think about fertility and pregnancy, what you find really are products that are just kind of outdated and not user-friendly.""
Brown was also the company's first employee.
The sense in marketing fertility and pregnancy products to millennials is clear, given most new mothers right now belong to the generation.

New Delhi Delhi, India(NewsVoir) The Abdul Latif Jameel Poverty Action Lab (J-PAL) South Asiaand Veddis Foundationannounced the launch of the Alliancefor Scaling Policy Impact through Research and Evidence(ASPIRE) today. ASPIRE aims to spur the adoption of anti-poverty policies rooted in scientific evidence and data. Veddis Foundationis anchoring ASPIRE with an investment of USD 6.3M.
ASPIRE is designed to bring together governments, donors and nonprofits to solve some of the most pressing challenges Indiansliving in poverty are facing today, building on J-PALSouth Asias 15 years of work in poverty reduction in the country. Over 100 million people across 20 Indianstates have been reached by programmes and policies that have been informed by studies done by researchers who are part of J-PALsglobal network. J-PALis well recognized worldwide for its work in using rigorous scientific evidence to help policy makers. The Co-founders of J-PALAbhijit Banerjee and Esther Duflowere awarded the Nobel Prize for Economicsin 2019 for their pioneering work done in using Randomised Control Trials(RCTs) in alleviating global poverty.
ASPIRE will help J-PAL
South Asia
to respond even more effectively to the policy priorities of governments, with the goal of rolling out innovative policy solutions that have been tested for effectiveness with randomised controlled trials.
J-PAL South Asiawill enter into long-term partnerships with governments and do a thorough examination of the policy challenges hindering poverty eradication. The alliance also plans to run pilot studies on prospective solutions and to scale up the most promising ones. An initiative like ASPIRE is more urgent now than ever.
The economic crisis triggered by the COVID-19 pandemic threatens to undo the gains Indiahas made over the years in poverty alleviation. It is vital for governments to implement policies with proven effectiveness to support the people whose lives have been upended by the pandemic. In October 2021, Veddis Foundationhad announced a Rs. 100 crore commitment to accelerate large-scale social impact. Shobhini Mukerji Executive Director, J-PAL

said, ASPIRE has been conceived to make scientific evidence and data the bedrock of policymaking in India. It is only by advancing policies that are backed by solid evidence of effectiveness can governments succeed in improving the lives of the poor and the vulnerable in a timely, holistic and effective manner. The grant from the Veddis Foundationopens up exciting new possibilities for us to establish new, long-term partnerships with multiple state governments and central agencies. Murugan Vasudevan CEO of Veddis Foundationsaid, Philanthropy can drive transformational positive impact by building stronger state capacity. We are glad to be partnering with J-PALin setting up ASPIRE. J-PALbrings a rare combination of rigor, innovation, and demonstrated results in shaping data-driven policies that form the bedrock of good governance. We look forward to seeing ASPIRE become a trusted partner to governments and philanthropists looking to drive impact at scale.

For six years, Melody Lee dealt with abscessed and infected teeth, going to the hospital emergency room when the pain became too great to bear.
Lee, 42, subcontracts for a painting company and last had dental insurance in 2005, when she had a basic care policy through Florida Medicaid. She hadn't seen a dentist since, but she knew the cost of the extractions and fillings she needed would top $4,000.
PDF:
Community Health Assessment on oral health
""That is well out of my price range, and I'd went so long without dental care, it was just too much to be done,"" said Lee, who has three children. ""I barely keep the regular bills paid.""
When she saw information about a Remote Area Medical clinic in Clinton last winter, she and a friend spent the night in a parking lot to get a spot. There she had four teeth pulled. At a second clinic in Bristol in April, she got three fillings and a cleaning. She'll have two more teeth filled at a future RAM clinic.
""The volunteers were so friendly, they made us feel totally welcome and at ease not the usual getting frowned upon and judged for needing help,"" Lee said. ""Frankly, it was embarrassing to show my teeth, in the shape they were in, to a dentist.""
RAM founder Stan Brock said he estimates close to 100 percent of people who come to RAM's events which provide medical, dental and vision care at no cost need dental work. Given a choice between that and vision, he said, about 70 percent choose dental.
""Infections from bad teeth lead to all kinds of ominous problems, such as diabetes and heart disease,"" Brock said. ""It's one of the most serious health-care issues.""
Yet it's a problem almost half the population doesn't have the resources to address. Health Department statistics indicate 62 percent of Knox County residents visited a dentist last year, a gradual decline over the past 10 years. In the surrounding rural counties, where dentists are scarce, the numbers are lower. And they're significantly lower among poorer people: 34 percent of those whose annual household income is less than $15,000 a year saw a dentist last year. Yet most Medicaid programs including TennCare and Gov. Bill Haslam's proposed Insure Tennessee plan don't include dental benefits.
In Knox County last year, 8 percent of all adults and 21 percent of all adults older than 65 reported having all their teeth pulled because of infection, tooth decay or gum disease. Black senior citizens were nearly twice as likely as whites 36 percent, compared to 19 percent to have had all their teeth pulled. And 43 percent of Knox County residents of all ages have had at least one tooth pulled because of infection. In most rural counties, the percentage is higher.
""We've been going to Wise County, Va., every year for 15 years,"" Brock said. ""Every year there we will extract right around 4,000 teeth in two days and two hours, (plus 1,900 fillings). Which absolutely amazes me, since the patient count is around 3,000 and it's the same people coming (each year). That is an example of just how desperate the situation is for dental care for the poor and not-so-poor people of this country.""
Interfaith Health Clinic has provided dental care since 1991, said director Melissa Knight. Knight said most patients either had dental insurance and lost their jobs or dropped their policies because they couldn't afford them, or have gone years without care and are now having dental emergencies.
The clinic has one paid dentist and one paid hygienist, who see patients two days a week, said dental coordinator Paula Mays. She schedules as many other appointments as possible, depending on how many volunteer shifts she can fill. Most months, the clinic serves 80-110 uninsured dental patients, who pay on a sliding scale.
""The majority of our patients need several things more than just a filling,"" Mays said, and dental problems can exacerbate other health issues.
She has a periodontist who's agreed to see two patients a year on the sliding scale, an orthodontist who will treat two children annually with serious problems, and an endodontist who takes referrals. But more volunteers, or money to hire more dental staff, rank at the top of Mays' wish list. While the waiting list currently sits at three weeks, sometimes it's long enough that only emergencies are taken.
""We've got four chairs that we wish we could fill every single day,"" Knight said. ""And we're open at night we'd love to have it staffed then, too.""

Islanders Open Coliseum to Healthcare Heroes
The Islanders treated 1,000 Northwell Health employees and their families to the first game in front of fans in over a year
by Cory Wright
@WrightsWay
/ NewYorkIslanders.com
For a full year, healthcare heroes have been looking out for everyone else. On Thursday night, the New York Islanders wanted to make sure that someone was looking out for them.
One day shy of the one-year anniversary of the NHL's COVID-19 pause, the Islanders opened Nassau Coliseum to fans, with 1,000 healthcare heroes - deservedly - being the first ones through the door.
""Having the healthcare workers in there tonight is extra special,"" Head Coach Barry Trotz said pregame. ""We make sacrifices as coaches and athletes and families, but they've made the ultimate sacrifice. They put themselves in harm's way to keep other people safe and alive. It's special for them to be back in the building and I think our building deserves to have people in it.""
The game was a small gesture from the team, who welcomed the healthcare heroes as special guests. The night was dedicated to them, from free t-shirts waiting on their socially-distanced seats, to personalized thank you video messaging from the team, Trotz and General Manager Lou Lamoriello. Four Northwell Health workers, each outfitted with a blue ""Hero"" jersey, dropped the puck in a pre-recorded ceremony. Sparky banged a pot at 7 p.m. sharp, an acknowledgement of the nightly salute to healthcare heroes from early on during the pandemic.
""We've been looking forward to getting fans back in the building for a long time,""
Josh Bailey
said. ""It was a great way to honor our healthcare workers tonight and to have them be the first ones in attendance, they brought some energy for us and we fed off it. It was about saying thank you for all the sacrifices they made along the way and it was about them tonight and happy to get the win in front of them.""
Video: Islanders Thank Healthcare Heroes
The excitement was reciprocated by the healthcare heroes, who described returning to the coliseum as emotional and as an exhale, a chance to relax after working relentlessly over the past year.
""It's a great feeling,"" said Rebecca Reinold, an Outpatient Nurse at Family Medicine in Lindenhurst. ""My fianc and I are Season Ticket Members, we were at the last game before the COVID pandemic started, so it really boosted our morale to watch games when they started coming back and playing and even better to see it live. It's very emotional. I feel like I get choked up, it's a very good feeling to have a little bit of normalcy. Everyone in this company works really hard, so everyone deserves it.""
Reinhold, who was an honorary flag captain earlier in the year, wasn't in her usual seats in section 213, though they were occupied by her cardboard cutout. She said watching the video tributes before the game was an emotional experience and thanked the Islanders for everything they'd done for Northwell Health employees, especially after a chaotic and demanding year.
""It means a lot that they value healthcare workers,"" Reinhold said. ""It's been chaotic, there have been a lot of questions, a lot of things as healthcare workers we didn't think we'd have to face, but especially Northwell, everyone is very team oriented and I think that's why we gravitate towards hockey and towards the Islanders because we all really pulled together. There was not one second where I didn't feel safe or supported or important to this company, or to this team.""
Video: Healthcare Heroes Drop Puck
There was a buzz in the building right as doors reopened for the Coliseum. Laurie Zottarelli, a 32-year Northwell employee who has helped supply and distribute medical equipment for LIJ and Cohen Children's Medical Center, described it as surreal. The good kind though, not the type she'd seen in the hospital for the past year.
""I've been there 32 years and I've never seen anything like this,"" she said of the pandemic. ""We had adults in [Cohen's]. That's never happened. We moved out the kids to bring adults in. It's crazy. And we built a 65-bed unit, that's the biggest thing I'm proud of, that we came together all the teams and had a unit built in three weeks to house COVID patients. It is a 65-bed unit and we only have 22 patients currently, which is a good thing.""
Zottarelli, who was decked out in a blue Bryan Trottier jersey, said she was appreciative for everything Northwell had done to keep staff safe and for all the work the Islanders had done for healthcare heroes, including food and cookie drops at the hospitals throughout the pandemic.
""The doctors, the respiratory therapists, the first responders, they deserve all the props,"" Zottarelli said. ""They're still on the front lines.""
The healthcare heroes had something to cheer for, as the Islanders beat the Devils 5-3. Six fans also went home with team-signed jerseys as the lucky seats of the game and the team saluted the crowd after the win. Reinhold, who was at the last game with fans before the pandemic last March, said it just felt good to be back.
""It feels like I never left in a way,"" Reinhold said. ""I know it's a little different and the precautions are great, everyone is being as safe as possible, so it's just a different feeling, but feels like things are getting better finally.""",HERO Health,event organization,executive statement,,,

After seeing the Post's article, Austin Watson Ltd, builders and joiners of New Longton, decided they wanted to help the charity with their windows at no cost to the church.
Operations Manager at Austin Watson Paul Biscoe said: ""One of our chaps, whose mum goes to church quite bit, heard about the story and just fired it into one of our Whatsapp groups, asking if there was anyway we could help, so I contacted the church, and our lads went down and sorted it out for them for free.
""Its not all about profit for our company, we work a lot in the community, and were quite proud of the fact that were able to help out in incidents like that. We do experience it with schools, when theres been play areas smashed up and things like that, so its just not nice to see and obviously we might lose out on a bit of labour costs but its just nice to help out really.""
Director and Company Secretary of Genesis Care, Pat Albrow, by one of the broken windows, sticky back plastic was covering the hole.
Director and Company Secretary of Genesis Care, Pat Albrow, said: ""It came out of the blue, and it made us feel really good, after being a bit down about the actual damage, it was really nice that somebody out there was going to do some good as a result of it.
""They were very efficient, they came and measured up and it was only within a couple of weeks that they came along with the glass and swapped it over, so weve no more holes in the window and its lovely.
""Were very very grateful and would like to say a big thank you, it meant a lot to us and its really good that they did this for us.""
As well as the charitable deed by Austin Watson Ltd, the Post's original story also prompted another charitable offer from a local woman, who donated 20 to Genesis Care.
The team at Austin Watson Ltd help out the community often with incidents like this.
Pat explained: ""We had a telephone call from a lady who had also read the bit in the paper and thought it was quite dreadful that somebody had done that to the church windows and she said she would like to send a donation, so she sent us a cheque which was really kind of her, it will go towards the amenities and doing activities with the service users, so that was lovely.""

467,HNI Corporation: Attractive Valuations And A Good Dividend Yield (NYSE:HNI),"Follow
Summary
The increase in backlog orders and reopening of offices should drive HNIs organic growth in 2022.
The company is also improving profitability through restructuring initiatives and price increases.
The stock is attractively priced at ~13.47x FY22 EPS and a ~3.39% dividend yield.
onurdongel/E+ via Getty Images
The workplace furnishing segment of HNI Corporation (
NYSE:
HNI
) is expected to benefit as the office reopens, especially in urban markets. In addition, the company-specific growth initiatives such as improved profitability, new facility investments, pricing increases, and restructuring actions should help drive revenue and margins growth. The company was able to increase its backlog orders for the workplace as well as the residential building products segment last year which should help HNI's revenue growth in 2022. The stock looks attractive trading at ~13.47x its FY22 consensus EPS estimates with a forward dividend yield of 3.39%.
Business Basics and Recent Earnings
HNI Corporation is a manufacturer and provider of furnishing and hearth products. The company has two reportable segments: workplace furnishing and residential building products. The workplace furnishing items include seating, tables, storage, and other products whereas they sell hearth products (including fireplaces, inserts, stoves, and accessories) under residential building products. The workplace furnishing segment's end market includes contract (large corporations where furniture orders are customized according to the client or architecture), e-commerce, and SMB (small and medium-sized business) channels while the residential products are sold to homebuilders and remodelers. The workplace furnishing segment contributed ~66% and the residential building products contributed ~34% of the total revenue in FY 2021.
HNI Corporation reportedQ4 2021 revenue of $602.9 million (up ~7.3% YoY), beating the consensus estimate of $596.3 million, but EPS fell ~35% from $0.66 in Q4 2020 to $0.43 (vs. $0.41 consensus estimate). The adjusted operating income for the quarter fell ~34.6% from $39.5 million Q4 2020 to $25.8 million in Q4 2021, with adjusted operating margins falling 270 basis points from 7% to 4.3%. The 4% organic growth and acquisitions of Design Public Group (""DPG"") and multiple residential building products companies contributed to the increase in revenue. During the quarter, these acquisitions increased sales by $18.5 million on a year-over-year basis. The cost inflation related to commodities and freight (which was partially offset by lower SG&A costs) contributed to the drop in the adjusted operating margin and EPS during the quarter.
Revenue Growth Potential
In FY21, net sales increased 11%, owing to 27.3% Y/Y growth in the residential building products segment and 5% Y/Y growth in the Workplace Furnishing segment. Acquisitions added ~$47.3 million in incremental revenues during the fiscal year. Organic revenue for the workplace furnishing segment grew ~2.4% with higher volumes in the small and medium-sized businesses (SMB) channel and lower volumes in the contract and e-commerce channels. The lower contract market volume was due to a slower demand recovery as return-to-office plans were still inconsistent due to Covid-19. The e-commerce market also slowed compared to that of 2020 due to lower demand for work-from-home furniture. On the inorganic front, the acquisition of DPG increased overall sales by $34.9 million (or ~2.6 percent) in 2021.
For the residential building products segment, organic sales grew 25.3 percent and acquisitions of multiple building product companies added another ~$12.4 million in sales. The organic growth in this segment was fueled by strong volumes in the new construction and remodeling channels.
Looking forward, the reopening of urban markets should provide opportunities for the company's Workplace Furnishing segment to grow. As office reopening activity increases, sales of office furnishing products should increase with businesses upgrading their offices with new furniture. The backlog in the workplace furnishing business was $120 million higher than normal at the end of 2021. During the company's Q4 conference call talking about Workplace Furnishings outlook, its CFO Marshall H. Bridges (VP and CFO of HNI Corp.) said,
In Workplace Furnishings, we expect pricing benefits, backlog normalization and assumed market improvements to drive revenue growth rates in the high teens to low 20s for the year. I would also like to point out that we started 2022 with an elevated Workplace Furnishings backlog that will support solid growth. Segment backlog at the end of 2021 was approximately $120 million above normal levels.""
The company recently opened a new manufacturing facility for its Workplace Furnishing segment in Mexico, where the production is expected to ramp up through the first half of 2022. The increased production capacity coupled with a high backlog should help volume growth in 2022. The current inflationary costs have also resulted in the company taking price increases across the board. This price increase is expected to contribute 13 to 14 percent to total sales growth in 2022, while volume growth is expected to contribute 4 to 6 percent. The forecast for Workplace Furnishing sales growth in 2022 is in the high teens to low twenties. I believe that reopening of offices, strong sales growth and increased pricing will help the Workplace Furnishing segment achieve pre-Covid revenue levels (~$1.7 billion) in FY2022.
HNI's Workplace Furnishing segment net sales (in billions) (Company Data, GS Analytics Research)
The company is optimistic about the new construction sales and remodeling industry but given the rising interest rates and supply-chain-related challenges, new construction activity in 2022 may decline slightly. However, increased backlog orders (
$30 million
above the normal levels), the company-specific growth initiatives, and pricing should drive organic revenue growth, while the acquisitions of The Outdoor GreatRoom Company and Trinity Hearth and Home should support inorganic revenue growth. Trinity's Southwest distributor network should help HNI maintain its competitive advantage and support its expansion in the region.
Margin Recovery
In 2021, the adjusted operating margin fell 90 basis points to 4.6 percent, down from 5.5 percent the previous year. This was due to a drop in Workplace Furnishing segment margins from 2.9% to 1%, partially offset by a 40-basis-point margin improvement in the Residential Building Product segment from 18.5 percent to 18.9 percent. The decrease in margin was due to a negative price-cost environment caused by rising commodity and transportation costs. Furthermore, the company's cost increased as a result of the labor availability constraint, which increased wages. By increasing sales volume, raising prices, and lowering SG&A costs, the company was able to offset some of the inflationary costs and supply chain constraints.

473,Balfour at Palisades: A New Standard in Senior Living,"4
1058
For Michael Schonbrun and Susan Juroe, a Georgetown resident for 20 years, Balfour Senior Living has been a calling. Aging Baby Boomers-the Silver Tsunami want to age differently than their grandparents did, says Schonbrun. We are designing for ourselves.
The Great Room has immediate access to a lushly landscaped outdoor courtyard. NYC design firm Pembrooke & Ives and local developer Trammel Crow collaborated with Balfour on the 138-unit building featuring penthouses, a swimming pool, theatre and no large buy-in fees.
Native Content
A successful career as CEO of National Jewish Hospital and government nursing home regulator didnt come close to preparing Michael Schonbrun for the challenges of relocating his then recently widowed mother Madeline from the familys NYC apartment to senior living. The lessons learned from that journey is the origin story behind the soon-to-be-built Balfour at Palisades.
Quality is our standard says Schonbrun, CEO of Balfour Senior Living, a collection of boutique senior living communities. My mothers
joie de vivre
and life-long appreciation for the finer things in life have inspired us to meet her high standards in creating beautiful communities and a lifestyle that fulfills and delights our residents.
Founded 23 years ago, Balfour Senior Living is a Colorado-based company that started small by design and is now expanding its luxury boutique footprint to East Coast markets. It currently has 11 locations ten in Colorado and one in Michigan and its Washington, D.C. and Brookline, MA communities are expected to deliver in 2023. Were not looking to be the biggest, explains Susan Juroe, the companys Co-founder, and General Counsel. Our goal is to be the best and most admired in our category by creating unique environments that enrich the lives of the people who live and work there. We also feel strongly about offering our residents a beautiful and compelling destination where their friends and families can also enjoy Balfours amenities and hospitality.
The architecture of Balfour at Palisades was informed by local art deco landmarks the neighborhoods Glen Echo Amusement Park, MacArthur Theater, and the glamourous residential buildings of that era such as the Kennedy-Warren. Balfour partnered with the local developer Trammell Crow, award-winning architecture firm Perkins Eastman which brought the stylized art deco design to life, and NYC design firm Pembrooke and Ives who brought best-in-class residential design experience and made them ideal collaborators for this project.
Balfour at Palisades will feature 138 apartment homes with a variety of floor plans, including studios, one- and two-bedrooms, one bedroom with dens and one- and two-bedroom penthouse apartments. Of these, ten units are part of D.C.s Inclusionary Zoning program and are income restricted. Residents will have the convenience of a range of services centered around their lifestyle and needs from independent living to assisted living, and memory care. The amenities include seasonally inspired culinary offerings at breakfast, lunch and dinner, seven days a week in three dining venues, indoor saltwater pool, sauna, fitness center and yoga studio, hair salon, theatre, a library, bar, housekeeping and home maintenance services, valet parking for residents and their guests, reserved covered parking, rooftop access and a Tesla fleet staffed with Balfour drivers to meet scheduled or spontaneous local transportation needs.
The Balfour at Palisades community spaces feature exceptional quality architecture, dcor and art where future residents can proudly welcome their families and friends. The bar evokes the mood of some of DCs iconic clubs and restaurants.
Balfours model does not have a large buy-in fee, instead charging monthly rent plus a la carte levels of care when or if needed. Its a model that requires Balfour to earn your trust every day and allow for flexibility should a relocation or changed life circumstances arise. Additionally, couples can stay together with care brought into their apartment home if needed.
For Michael Schonbrun and his partner Susan Juroe, a Georgetown resident for 20 years, Balfour represents a personal calling. We wanted to create places where residents can welcome their friends and families and enjoy wonderful experiences together. The Palisades is designed for ease of living and engagement within and beyond our community. Residents can enjoy all that the Palisades neighborhood offers only steps away from their front door and all that the Washington, D.C. area has to offer. Another plus: Balfour is pet friendly. Residents can move in with their pets and Its common for some pet-less residents to adopt pets after theyve settled in. Balfour at Palisades will feature an indoor off-leash pet park and a pet grooming station.
The silver tsunami is nowhere close to cresting according to AARP and other senior advocacy groups. Baby Boomers (sorry, Millennials!) are still making their influence known in all sorts of ways. To be honest, we designed Balfour for ourselves. And for Madeline, of course! Michael admits. We thought seriously of what we would like and need to feel comfortable, what it meant to feel at home and have that pride of place thats something were always working on. Susan adds, Were also mindful of the challenges people are facing as they age. Loneliness, depression, and lack of physical, mental, and emotional stimulation are real health hazards. At Balfour, were creating communities where everyone can feel valued and welcome and are free to discover new interests and friendships.
Local architects Perkins Eastman took inspiration from the art deco buildings in the Palisades as well as the grand historic residential buildings in Washington, DC to create a design compatible with the neighborhood. Balfour at Palisades is set to open in 2023.
Balfour at Palisades will be located at 4865 MacArthur Blvd NW, D.C. 20007 and is expected to open in 2023. The leasing center address is 4418 MacArthur Blvd., NW.

Hudson Regional Hospital's procurement of the da Vinci XI robotic surgical system which follows its recent acquisition of the Mazor Robotics Renaissance Surgical Guidance System is the most recent example of the hospital's new ownership's commitment towards investing in advanced technologies that will greatly benefit the community. These minimally invasive treatment options can drastically improve the quality of life for patients with significantly reduced recovery time.
""As the role of technology in modern medical care grows larger every year, we believe there is substantial opportunity to expand robotic usage across all our practice areas,"" said Dr. Nizar Kifaieh, President and CEO of Hudson Regional Hospital. ""As such, we continuously assess available or emerging technologies, such as the multi-limbed da Vinci system that enables our surgeons to perform better and with minimal invasion therefore benefitting our surgical teams and ultimately, our patients. Our goal is to put the right technology in the hands of our capable and skilled surgeons to provide patients with the best possible clinical outcome.""
Considered one of the most dynamic tools for robotic surgery in the world, the da Vinci robotic surgery system delivers a high degree of fidelity and precision in the control of surgical instruments.

Dr. Asulin continued, ""The techniques available with the da Vinci robotic surgical system result in significantly reduced post-operative pain, very small incisions, little to no blood loss, much quicker recovery, and a significantly less aggressive opioid pain medication regimen an important consideration. We can typically send patients home the same day or the morning following a procedure.""
In addition to gynecological procedures, the da Vinci robotic surgical system will provide minimally invasive surgical options for patients who have prostate cancer, herniation, bariatric surgery, and general surgery.

488,Our Guide to Every Boot UGG Makes for Men,"UGG boots
were original to surf circles. The boots offered surfers respite after long, cold sessions catching waves, courtesy of their high rise capable of covering the toes, feet and shins and sheepskin liners that lock in heat. This was the '70s along the coast in California, long before UGGs became a staple of cozycore, a term for fashion sense driven exclusively by comfort and comfort alone. They were beloved because they were easy... It's funny how some things don't change with time.
The History of UGG Boots
But ugg boots yes, lowercase ugg boots, as a reference to the style not the brand have a long history that predates the US-born brand. Uggs, although heavily debated, can be traced as far back as 1920 in rural Australia. There, the story goes, shearers trusted these boots over others because they could withstand the greasiness of wool. (The grease would otherwise ruin most boots.) But there's also an Australian surfer that claims he invented the style, since no one can really prove the shearers did it first. Other trademarks akin to ugg UGH, UGH-BOOTS, Uggs-N-Rugs cropped up in the 60s and 70s, but without the legal standing to be the sole supplier of the style. In fact, they were so common in Australia shoppers rarely knew the name of the brand that made them, instead calling them just as they were colloquially known as uggs. (In court, one of the so-called inventors said the name is a play on initial reactions: an abbreviation for ""ugly."")
Stateside, UGGs were initially an independent hit. Australia-born founder (and surfer) Brian Smith launched the company with a small round of fundraising from family and friends after a relatively unsuccessful stint as an importer of ugg-style boots from down under. He was in school at UCLA and part of tight-knit surf communities in San Diego and Santa Cruz. Surf shops propelled UGG sales early on, but ad campaigns that ""featured models 'who couldnt surf,'"" totally didn't help, Smith told Forbes. It wasn't until he ""ran ads of young pro surfers"" that ""sales jumped to $400k in one season,"" he explained.
An appearance on Oprah's annual ""favorite things"" list, a commercial with Tom Brady, cameos in movies and TV shows and on the feet of hundreds of celebrities (and lots of moms), skyrocketed the sheepskin footwear, which, by then, was fully owned by Deckers, which also owns Hoka One One,
Teva
and Sanuk. Trademark battles have been waged on UGG a million times over, but the brand retains ownership of its name in the US and 100-plus countries. It's their popularity, I believe, and their dissolution into everyday Americanism, that's made them uniquely their own and covetable still after several steep ups and downs.
Why UGG Boots?
Their catalog includes slippers and sneakers, but we're here for the boots. For surfers, they made a lot of sense: They were easy to put on, warm, could withstand salty ocean water and sand and required little maintenance. That means most of the reasons they were popular then are what's keeping them around: the comfortable sheepskin construction, the fluffy wool insides, their cushioned foam insoles and, of course, their color which is nearly as signature as their shape.
I'd implore you to try them even if you feel extremely adverse. At worst, they're your new waddle-from-desk-t0-bed, work-from-home shoes. At best, you're strutting the grocery store aisles like a suburban Tom Brady (or a cool-ass Australian surfer looking for post-sesh snacks). W either way. And, I promise you the ""stigma"" you associate with UGGs and men wearing UGGs especially is merely made up. Tom Brady might've gotten the meme treatment for his advert in them, but he laid the groundwork for a generation of cozy boys behind him. (I wonder if Brady has a closet full of UGGs waiting for him in retirement?)
UGG Boots for Men
UGG makes an assortment of staple boots and variations of those staples, which is why you'll see the Classic Boot in both Mini and Short heights or the Neumel Boot as the Neumel Boot but also the Neumel Strapback, Neumel Cozy and Neumel Chelsea, for example. And UGG makes more than just sheepskin slippers, you know: They do Chelsea Boots, Duck Boots, Rain Boots, Snow Boots, and beyond. Explore all 30 yes, 30 styles below.

$133 AT UGG
Imagine, for a second, you're in an office; your office, a fictional one, it doesn't matter much. It could be a restaurant for all I care. No one there would know these were UGG boots. And that's not my way of saying UGG boots are a bad look (clearly not). If you're still skittish about the stigma that comes with a Classic Short Boot, go with a more traditional Chelsea. The Baldvin Boot is a traditional Chelsea.

494,Response Link Review for January 2021,"Response Link
Cost: Starting at $19.95/month
ResponseLINK has come a long way during their almost 20 years in the medical alert systems industry. Originally created out of a partnership between Advantor Corp. and Bell South, this company has moved away from its previous distributor-based sales model with an updated, easy-to-use website that allows customers to order directly - no salesperson required.
You'll find two basic, no-frills options when buying a medical alert system through ResponseLINK. Neither plan requires a long-term contract or equipment fees, and both come with free 1-5 business day shipping:
In-Home Alert: starting at $19.95/month, this system uses a landline to connect users to their 24/7 monitoring center. The waterproof, wearable pendant-style panic button has a 600-foot range from the base station. If you'd like a system that automatically detects falls, you can choose the system that includes that feature for $30.95/month. The ResponseLINK site doesn't specify whether that system usesa landline, but the equipment photos look exactly like the In-Home system - so it's probably safe to assume you'll need a landline.
Mobile Alert: starting at $30.95/month, this system uses a device that looks something like an old-style pager and uses GPS location through the T-Mobile cellular network to provide help wherever the person goes.
We weren't thrilled to see that the ResponseLINK site proudly proclaims an A+ rating with the Better Business Bureau, because the BBB site showed a lower grade of just ""A"".  Most of the complaints there centered around their sister site, Alert1, which offers several equipment/service plans not available through ResponseLINK.
One frequent area of complaint is billing. You can save money by paying for your medical alert service annually or semi-annually, but buyer beware: we found many customers complaining that they were not able to get a refund for unused months if they had to cancel the service (e.g. if the user passed away or entered hospice care). You can only get ResponseLINK's ""30 day risk-free money-back guarantee"" onservice planspaid in advance, not monthly billing, but for many customers that just means a big fight with customer service to actually get their prepaid money back.
Seniors and their caregivers need the best technology combined with excellent customer service and hassle-free billing. ResponseLINK's medical alert systems fall very short in all three of those criteria. We strongly suggest you choose a more customer-friendly service provider.",ResponseLink,company description,,,,

Unraveling Rose is a beautifully illustrated story written to help children and families understand obsessive thoughts and behaviors, and how to stop them from getting in the way of enjoying everyday life. Brian Wray uses soft imagery allowing families to tackle tough issues in a way that relates to young children.
Mr. Owlivers Magic at the Museum teaches children about art and design. Bracken introduces us to Mr. Owliver, a night watchman for the Animaltown Art Museum, and his whimsical world of famous masterpieces like the Mona Lizard and Auguste Wrenoirs The Loge. The story of how Mr. Owliver comes to find that all the characters have disappeared from their frames is an engaging glimpse into the world of art history. In addition, the book includes a glossary listing the origins and artists of the paintings in the book and an art history timeline perfect for any burgeoning art history major.
Q: Sticks N Stones N Dinosaur Bones is the first in the Unhinged History book series. Will Schiffer publish more books from the series? Do you plan to publish more childrens books by Ted Enik or other childrens books illustrated by G.F. Newland?
[Tracee] Ted and G.F. are working on finalizing the next book in the Unhinged History book series featuring another infamous rivalry, this time racing to the bottom of the sea. Stay tuned for more details!
[Pete] We do plan to work with both Ted Enik and G.F. Newland on future projects and are discussing several new projects. There are many creative ideas that these two can bring to life to educate and inspire the next generation.
Q: Tell us about Schiffer Publishing, its history, and its mission?
[Tracee] Our childrens book category has a long history rich in regional favorites like Chadwick the Crab and Lobsters on the Loose as well as the perennial classics The Future Architects Handbook, Change the World Before Bedtime, and The Angry Little Puffin. Our mission is to continue to produce timely and curated Chesapeake Bay regional titles while ramping up an expansion of Science, Technology, Engineering, Arts, and Mathematics (STEAM) learning. We are delighted to present our new mascot, Amelia. Amelia, like the Boston Terriers who came before her on the book farm, is a lively, smart, and affectionate girl who is enthusiastic to learn. She is leading the way at Schiffer Kids by announcing our new STEAM initiative in the 2017 childrens book catalog.
[Pete] Schiffer Publishing was founded in 1974 on our family farm with the aim to educate collectors about the things that they love. Over the years, we have focused on creating publications that serve readers passions and unique interests while providing new information and inspiration. This idea has lead us to develop a diverse publishing program where we focus on subjects that people care about deeply and develop their knowledge with over 6,000 titles in print. Our childrens books complement many of the areas we know well and are an extension of this philosophy to look for and serve peoples unique passions while educating them.

This first book in Ted Enik and G.F Newlands Unhinged History series is a ripping yarn full of adventure and deceit that brings to life the best-known public spat in all of paleontology: the bitter rivalry between Edward Drinker Cope and Othniel Charles Marsh that became known as The Bone Wars. Lively and witty rhymes plus beautifully demented illustrations by Newland reveal how the paleontologists infamous rivalry began and how their mutual obsession with outdoing and ruining one another spun out of control.

Getty Images
Paramount CEO Bob Bakish announced in an internal memo to staff on Tuesday the steps that the company is taking to pause its business operations in Russia, becoming the latest Hollywood company to do so.
Bakish also announced that Paramount will be donating $1 million to support humanitarian relief efforts in Ukraine, and employees in the U.S. and UK can participate in a donation matching program set up by Paramount.
In addition to the previously announced plan to halt the theatrical releases of Sonic the Hedgehog and The Lost City, Paramount is now also taking additional steps. Among them, Simon & Schuster has suspended sales to accounts in Russia, along with the licensing of translation rights to Russian publishers. Paramount Consumer Products will pause all new licensing deals in Russia. And while there are other contractual and technical partner complexities, the distribution of linear channels and some content licensing is also being paused.

Since the beginning of this crisis, our teams across the world have been working around the clock to determine the best, and most importantly  safest  ways we as a business can show our support for all those impacted, Bakish wrote in his memo. I want to be clear, the safety and security of employees and all those who work with us is, and will always be, our top priority. We continue to offer specialized support services to hundreds of staff, freelance and fixed term employees in Ukraine, Russia, and Poland whose lives are being impacted by this crisis.
You can read the full memo to Paramount employees below:
Team,
Like many of you, I am closely following the devastating, unprovoked invasion of Ukraine. The resulting humanitarian crisis and its ripple effects on the lives of millions of people across Ukraine, Eastern Europe, and in Russia itself, is heartbreaking to witness.
Since the beginning of this crisis, our teams across the world have been working around the clock to determine the best, and most importantly  safest  ways we as a business can show our support for all those impacted. I want to be clear, the safety and security of employees and all those who work with us is, and will always be, our top priority. We continue to offer specialized support services to hundreds of staff, freelance and fixed term employees in Ukraine, Russia, and Poland whose lives are being impacted by this crisis.
We are taking a series of steps to suspend our operations in Russia, including pausing the supply of Paramount Global content. We have announced that Paramount Pictures will pause the theatrical release of our upcoming films in Russia, including The Lost City, and Sonic the Hedgehog 2. Simon & Schuster has suspended sales to accounts in Russia, along with the licensing of translation rights to Russian publishers. Additionally, Paramount Consumer Products will pause all new licensing deals in Russia. Other activity, including the distribution of linear channels and some content licensing, will take more time to pause due to existing contractual, technical and partner complexities.
We are also making a $1M donation to support humanitarian relief. In addition to the corporate donation, employees are encouraged to directly help those in need as this humanitarian crisis unfolds. Eligible employees in the UK and the US can take advantage of the Paramount Matching Program, which we are working to expand to additional international regions (more information will follow shortly).
In addition, we are using our content and capabilities to help those in need, including the power of our global platforms to ensure the world bears witness to this tragedy, as well as to support humanitarian relief efforts. The courageous news teams at CBS News, Channel 5, Chilevision, Network 10, and Telefe have been reporting around the clock from on the ground in Ukraine and neighboring countries.
Channel 5 recently aired a fundraising special, Ukraine: How YOU Can Help, in the UK. MTVE has initiated a global call to action across linear and social for audiences to donate funds to support relief efforts across several organizations, including World Central Kitchen, International Medical Corps, Save The Children, UN Refugee, UNICEF and more. Our Consumer Products team is donating toys, products, and funds to organizations that are supporting kids and families from Ukraine who are seeking refuge. And, our team is working to quickly bring Ukrainian-language kids content to European countries like Germany, Switzerland, Austria, Italy, Spain and France for free on Pluto TV, and to Poland through local Nickelodeon distribution partners. And theres more underway and to come.
As we pause our operations, we will continue to financially support our dedicated team in Moscow. I also ask everyone across the business to please be sensitive to the effect this crisis is having on colleagues across Europe, and particularly those who are Ukrainian, Russian, and in Eastern Europe.
We will provide additional updates as we have them.

Back to video
1. The classes are fantastic
Through the app, you can access live and archived classes. To search archived classes, there is a very helpful filter. Each day I selected a 30 to 45 minute advanced session, but the classes range from five minutes to an hour. The difficulty levels are beginner, intermediate, advanced and expert. I was more than challenged by advanced. I completed barre, strength, cardio, yoga, Pilates and toning classes, and me and my sweat towel enjoyed each one.
2. Great at-home solution, doesnt replace in-person
Prior to living my best COVID-19 lockdown life, I was in a yoga studio every day for six years. At my studio, I participated in yoga, barre and Pilates classes, so Im quite familiar with the movements used in these exercises. Even though I took over 2,000 classes, I still needed realignment every time. As my very favourite ex-Pilates instructor used to say, if youre looking in the mirror, youre out of alignment. Alignment is important to prevent injuries and encourage the effectiveness of the exercise.
If I had the MIRROR, and had the built-in camera turned on, the instructor could see me if I was participating in a live class. But with a few hundred people in each class, the instructor cant really make personalized alignment suggestions for everyone.

3. Do I need the MIRROR or just the app?
I completed a 14-day challenge with just the app and mission successful. I did connect with some people over Instagram who have and love the MIRROR, stating its the best purchase theyve made. With the MIRROR, you get features that arent available if you just have the app, like competition mode and the two-way video.
The gear
I started the challenge sporting lululemons
Like a Cloud Bra
and
InStill HR Tight
and love them both. The bra is as cloud-like as a sports bra can get. Its a mid-support bra thats easier to get on and off than other styles. The InStill tights are perfect for yoga, barre and Pilates, there arent any pockets on the legs, so not ideal for me and running. I ended the challenge wearing luluemons Cool Racerback Tankfrom over a decade ago thats still going strong. And then I wore Roots sweatpants, because I put pure comfort first for my final class. (Well, final class of the challenge, going to continue taking the classes.)

Its no secret that we love lululemon. Aside from it being a huge Canadian success story, the brand makes such effective technical gear. For the first time since its founding in 1998, lululemon acquired another company,

Like with other live-streaming devices, MIRROR, which is currently on sale for $1,245 from $1,895, works on a monthly subscription model ($49/month) to access the training in addition to purchasing the mirror itself. The subscription comes with lots of styles and levels of fitness classes, including yoga, high-intensity interval training, barre, boxing, dance cardio, meditation and strength training.
The MIRROR is great because it takes up minimal space, the classes are taught by talented instructors and the cost of the item makes you want to use it so you dont feel guilty (in addition to feeling fantastic from fitness, obviously).
For the first time, non-subscribers can trial lululemons

Eleadora was earning a monthly rental of R494 316 from CJ Enterprises from the property.
Commercial Properties and Minlou Holdings are related parties to Dis-Chem as they are wholly-owned by directors, previous directors and prescribed officers of Dis-Chem, who collectively are also material shareholders of Dis-Chem.
In a statement, Dis-Chem said these acquisitions would enable it to reduce its rental costs and boost its assets on the balance sheet.
The transactions allow Dis-Chem to own three of its five distribution centres and achieve a reduction in rental expenses incurred outside the group, it said.
The ownership of the assets ensures that the group holds the necessary strategic assets for long-term growth.
The effective date of the transactions is March 1, but consolidation into the group will only become effective once the approvals from competition authorities have been met.
During the six-month period to August 31, Dis-Chem continued to take market share in all categories and delivered strong cash generation as its total income grew by 18.1 percent to R4.2 billion.
The group made capital expenditure of R84m on tangible and intangible assets for expansionary expenditure as it invested in additional stores as well as ICT enhancements.
The balance of R60m expenditure was incurred to maintain the existing retail and wholesale networks during the same six-month period.

Alaska Airlines announcedon Thursday that it is simplifying its fleet to just two aircraft types by the end of 2023, allowing the airline to cut operational costs and strengthen its loyalty to Boeing.
Alaska plans to retire all of its Airbus A320 family and Bombardier Q400 planes over the next 21 months, leaving the Embraer 175 as the airline's regional jet, and the Boeing 737 as its mainline workhorse.
Committing to just two aircraft types will allow ""operational simplicity, flexibility and scalability, better fuel efficiency, and reduced maintenance costs,"" according to the carrier.
""We're well-positioned to continue that trend, leveraging loyalty, alliances, network growth, and our brand to unlock significant value and deliver $400 million of incremental revenue as part of our 2025 strategic plan,"" Alaska CEO Ben Minicucci said in a press release. ""Accelerating our transition to single fleets while upgauging for growth is also a key part of that strategy.""
Alaska acquired 60 A320 family aircraft during its merger with Virgin America in 2016 but has since retired all of its A319s during the pandemic, ch-aviation reported It also obtained an order for 30 A321neo planes in the merger but canceled the order in late 2021.
While Alaska canceled the Airbus order and plans to retire nearly 80 jets, its fleet is expected to grow to about 400 planes come mid-decade, according to the airline. Currently, Alaska has 145 Boeing 737 MAX planes on order
Meanwhile, the carrier placed an order for 17 Embraer 175 jets in May 2021 to be operated by subsidiary Horizon Air and partner SkyWest Airlines, Reuters reported
Henry Harteveldt, travel analyst and president of Atmosphere Research Group, told Insider that Alaska's move was expected because of the cost advantages.
""There is a benefit to simplifying a fleet in many ways, from pilot and flight attendant training to maintenance costs,"" Harteveldt explained. ""There are thousands of parts you have to stock for routine day-to-day maintenance repair, as well as more comprehensive maintenance checks, but Alaska simplifying to the 737 will make it a much more cost-efficient airline.""
He also said that switching out an aircraft when one breaks down is easier with a simplified fleet.
Harteveldt told Insider that the retirement of the Q400 did surprise him, saying it's an ""excellent turboprop plane."" However, he believes it is likely that Alaska did not need enough of the small aircraft to justify the high pilot and maintenance costs needed to keep it in the fleet.
Alaska Airlines Q400 plane.
Alaska Airlines
Moreover, he explained that there are routes where the Embraer 175 may not be profitable, but the cost savings to fly a single regional aircraft versus two is worth the loss.
According to Harteveldt, Alaska's commitment to Boeing comes down to its history of operating the 737 and the number of the type in its fleet compared to Airbus, particularly since the carrier has adorned ""Proudly All Boeing"" on the nose of its 150-plus 737 planes.
""When you already have a sizeable majority of aircraft made by one company and you're looking to simplify, the decision is a fairly obvious one,"" he explained.

There are six elements in common between the companies analyzed and that allowed them to get ahead in the crisis.
The COVID-19pandemic plunged the world into a deep economic crisis whose consequences continue and will likely continue next year.
The '
Great Confinement
' led to business closures and company activities, which had to make cost cuts, layoffs and changes in their investment plans and, for which these measures were not enough, had to resort to declaring bankruptcy and, the survival of many is still in suspense.
However, there are also cases of companies that made decisions to adapt to the new global environment and not only to survive, but to increase their sales and create more jobs in the midst of the economic crisis.
The Spanish consulting firm DEFACTO identified 9 companies that, like chameleons, mimicked themselves so as not to fall prey to the crisis. In several cases, it involved reinventing their business models.

During the year, the consulting firm monitored the quarterly results of international companies from different industries that exceeded analysts' forecasts for the results they would have in 2020.
According to DEFACTO,
there are six elements in common between the companies analyzed and that allowed them to get ahead in the crisis
.
. The great importance given to the
insights
departments to know in depth the needs and preferences of consumers.
Innovation
. These companies made a strategic commitment to development and innovation
Supply chains
. They sought agility in logistics and stock management.
Risk management
. They carried out offshoring and diversification to reduce risk exposure.
Mix of experiences
. They did the correct hybridization of face-to-face and digital experience for clients.
Integrity in management
. The companies put a special emphasis on taking care of employees and the value chain and on sustainability.
Here are the global companies that best adapted to the crisis:
Zoom Video
The company reacted very quickly to respond to the sudden increase in demand: its users increased from 10 to 300 million between December 2019 and April 2020. In a very short time, they opened new data centers and signed new partnerships with strategic partners.

""Additionally, to address the growing interest of giants like Microsoft and Cisco in video conferencing, the company has frenziedly launched new developments,"" notes DEFACTO.
Salesforce
The company dedicated to the development of enterprise software managed to increase subscription revenue by 29% in the second quarter and has achieved historical results in the stock market thanks to the hyper-segmentation of clients and the development of innovations in record time.
""In just a few weeks since the pandemic broke out, the company developed two new packages of solutions aimed at facilitating company managers and area managers to manage the safe return of their employees to their jobs.""
Airbnb
The technology company has been able to recover in record time from the fall in tourism, and that the crisis could not have come at a worse time, since in January they were planning to go public.

Tesla
Restrictions on mobility during the spring caused a radical drop in bookings on its website. Airbnb's greatest success has been to adapt quickly to the new habits of its regular consumers, focusing on offering stays close to the visitor's place of residence and disinvesting in non-strategic areas , highlights the consultancy.
Elon Musk's company has skyrocketed in stock market value 330% in the past year, surpassing Toyota and becoming
the world's highest-valued auto manufacturer
. The main factor for its success has been the very high productivity rate it has managed to achieve, to the point of being close to the annual production target of half a million vehicles. But what's really amazing is that Tesla makes a 23.5% gross profit on every car made.
The company continues with its plans to geographically diversify its production in China and Germany, something that has benefited them this year, mitigating the impact of COVID-19.
The Home Depot
The chain of hardware stores knew how to adapt its offer and commercial strategy on time, canceling promotions to retailers and professionals to focus on the amateur DIY niche. As of April, pedestrian traffic in its establishments increased by more than 35% and its bulk of clients changed from professional profiles to amateurs.
In the second quarter they registered a growth of 23% year-on-year, reporting profits of 4.3 million dollars, 24.5% more than in 2019.
Amazon
The e-commerce giant started the year with many problems. As its demand grew meteorically, the news of imbalances in its logistics chain multiplied. Product shortages, shipping delays, strikes in logistics centers ...

But in just two months he turned the situation around.
Jeff Bezos
implemented a crash plan to overcome internal problems: general salary increases, training plans and many other concessions related to flexible hours. Since then, its profits have doubled and Amazon's stock market value has risen 40 percent.
Nestle
It is the company that has best known how to amortize the value of its food brands. When the pandemic altered consumer habits and the popularity of products such as soluble coffee or convenience foods increased.
It has also launched numerous innovations in line with new habits and has even bet on the health sciences business with the acquisition of a company dedicated to the development of food for allergy sufferers.
Ericsson
The Swedish company has achieved in 2020 one of its best historical years. Its gross margins have returned to 15 years ago and the forecasts could not be more positive in China, the United States and Europe.
The reason has its own name:
5G technology
. Thanks to his clever moves in the midst of the trade war between the United States and China, he has established a leadership position in both the West and Asia.
Asos
Since the first restrictive measures began to be imposed on movement, the most prominent products on its website included clothes to go around the house or specific gadgets for remote work.
Their agility in delivery and returns is one of the pillars of their marketing strategy, and during the pandemic they had the opportunity to demonstrate their excellence in this area.
Uniqlo
It has been one of the few companies that not only has not closed physical stores this year, but has increased their number, including with a huge interactive space, a mix of store and museum, in the center of Tokyo.
During the pandemic, they developed a mask adapting their breathable AIRsm fabric, which served as a hook product to increase the influx to their stores.

TCS head for Communication, Media & Information Services Kamal Bhadada told PTI that the company is already helping telecom operators across the globe in managing their networks, swapping equipment and technology providers.
When asked about the readiness of TCS to roll-out 5G network for telecom customers, Bhadada said, ""TCS can stitch it today. TCS is doing it today. So it's not about whether TCS is ready or not. TCS is ready. What we are working for in India is India-specific stack,"" Bhadada said.
BSNL is working with TCS and C-DoT to roll-out an indigenously developed 5G-enabled 4G network
The government expects the BSNL 4G network to be launched by August 15.
Bhadada said TCS is a system integrator and it builds networks of telecom operators based on their requirements.
The government is gearing up to hold 5G auctions before June so that 5G networks can also be launched by August 15.
""In my view 5G has at least 3 more years of cycle left before it starts, I mean India is in the very tail end of it. If you really look at it in the western markets everybody is in the middle of it. By 2023 or 2024 I feel all the 5G roll outs will be complete,"" Bhadada said.
He said that it will take another 3-4 years for full exploitation of the 5G network and then the process for 6G networks will start.
""6G is interesting, but I feel 5G will take five years for exploitation. I mean as I said 2-3 years for completing the rollouts and another 3-4 years for exploitation. 6G even in other markets is in my view at least four years away from any commercial right,"" he said.

528,Oil rich electricity poor. What will it take to solve Nigeria's energy crisis?,"Nigeria
Nigeria is Africa's biggest oil producer but the west African nation struggles to meet its energy needs, a struggle that has persisted for many decades.
On Monday, authorities in the country said they disbursed over 3.2 billion dollars to support power supply to Nigerians in the last five years. Godwin Emefiele who is head of the countrys apex bank, the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) said the monies were disbursed to electricity Generating and Distribution companies to acquire equipment or to buy meters and improve electricity supply in the country.
Yet Nigerians have continued to battle poor power supply with the situation worsening last week when the countrys power grid collapsed twice causing a huge black out across most parts of the country.
A 24-hour radio station in Lagos Beat Fm went off air, announcing moments before it could not run operations into the night. Several other businesses were impacted negatively. But this is not the first time that power grid collapses in the nation of over 200 million people.
According to TheCable, there were power grid collapses in February, May, July, and August of 2021 and there have been about 206 collapses between 2010 and 2019. So why was the power grid of last week different?
Power Grid ""Full System"" Collapse
Nigerias power generation is mostly thermal and hydro and has an installed capacity of nearly 13,000 megawatts. But for many years, authorities manage to dispatch only about 4,500 megawatts of its installed capacity. By contrast, South Africas total domestic electricity generation capacity is over 58,000 megawatts from all sources including coal which is by far its major energy source.
South Africa has a population of nearly 60 million according to 2020 figures and Nigeria is Africa's most populous nation, ranking tops amongst the biggest economies on the continent. When this reality is factored in, the disparity soon becomes evident and certainly not only on paper, but in the millions of homes in Nigeria that have to experience if at all any power supply, erratic electricity daily at its best.
But not many would have imagined the situation to get terribly worrisome recently.
Generators could not save the situation
Despite being Africa's largest producer of crude oil, Nigeria imports almost all of its fuel because none of its four refineries is operational, a paradoxical situation.
To avoid a spike in prices at the pump, the Nigerian government massively subsidizes Premium Motor Spirit known as Petrol. The price of which is fixed at 165 naira, about 40 cents. The price of diesel is higher than petrol and usually around I dollar per litter.
In dealing with the poor electricity supply, Nigerians for several years have relied heavily on small and huge generator sets operating on these products- petrol or diesel. These imported generating sets have served as an alternative source of power for Nigerians and in some occasions the only source. So when power supply from government and private operators drop, demand for petrol and diesel shoot up.
In February, a severe fuel shortage pushed prices up to 1.50 dollars per liter on the parallel market. The national oil company - the NNPC - announced that 100 million liters of adulterated petrol had been imported by mistake and had to be withdrawn from the market. A delay in cargo ships carrying refined oil due to the war in Ukraine was also blamed. Long queues soon lined the streets for days and weeks, climaxing into a huge almost nationwide black out last week.

MADISON, Wis. (AP) A coalition of animal rights groups plans to file a lawsuit to stop Wisconsins fall wolf hunt. Animal Wellness Action, Friends of Wisconsin Wolf and Wildlife, Protect Coyote and other groups say theyll file the lawsuit Tuesday morning.
The action comes after the state Department of Natural Resources board earlier this month set the quota for the fall hunt at 300 animals, disregarding pleas from multiple groups to cancel the season after hunters blew past their kill quota during a messy spring season in February.
The DNR set the kill limit at 119 animals but hunters killed 218, angering conservationists and animal rights groups.

537,Christians: Get an 'Israel box' delivered to your door,"(photo credit: Artza)

Artza Box founder Itai Schimmel was preoccupied with finding the answer to two questions: How could he create something that would connect Christians to Israelin a meaningful and educational way?
And how could he support small businesses all over Israel that were facing closures due to COVID-related travel restrictions?

His answer was Artza Box, a subscription gift box service that doesnt merely deliver gifts from Israel, but also forges a relationship between subscribers and the people, history and biblical significance of the land of Israel.
Each gift box focuses on a city or region in Israel, such as the Golan Heights, the Judean desert or Jerusalem and includes items from that city or region. Since their launch, Artza Box has sent 55,000 subscriber gift boxes, covering seven different cities or regions.
Their goal is to include eight or nine distinctive items, so each box contains, according to their website, something for the soul. Something to inspire. Something to learn. Something to taste. Something to share. Something for the body. Something to cook. Something to cherish.
But thats just the beginning.
Each box takes you on a journey, according to Schimmel. Were not just selling random gifts.
The Judean Desert Artza box (Credit: Artza)
He said Atrza boxes tell the stories of the people in the city, connecting to the people in the region. We try to deliver the experience of going to different regions.
To achieve that, each box includes lots of supplemental written material, including stories, crafts, recipe cards and even relevant Hebrew words and phrases that connect to the items in the box.
Each box includes information about one or two local charities, as well as products created by Jewish, Christians and Muslim artisans. Schimmel explained that sourcing the right local products can take as long as two months and the team is generally working six months ahead of distribution.
Once they identify a vendor with whom they want to work, an unexpected benefit of his business model is that often Artza Box places the largest order most of the vendors have ever had.
We help them learn to scale their businesses, he explained.
The Artza family
The gift box itself is the introduction to what Artza is trying to build out-of-the-box, Schimmel explained: Community.
Subscribers become part of what Schimmel called the Artza family and, in addition to receiving a gift box every three months, they are invited to participate in an array of online events, including master classes from chefs and artisans, virtual tours, live subscriber events, giveaways and more. All these are included with an Artza subscription.
Their plans for 2022 include adding in-person tours to Israel.
Schimmel said that, just as Artza boxes have been, bringing Israel to you, now we want to bring you to Israel.
A taste of Israel
The recipe cards have been among the most popular elements of Artza boxes. Schimmel, whose background is in venture capital, is currently raising funds on Kickstarter for Tasting Israel: A cookbook of food, family & faith.
Artzas cookbook will include two recipes each from 30 different Israeli chefs, each of whom represents a cuisine and a culture that exists in Israel, including Christians, Muslims and Jews from all over the world. The book will highlight the stories of how the chefs landed in Israel and what they contribute to the world of Israeli cuisine.
Every one of the 30 chefs has a unique connection to Israel. We are asking, What is Israeli cuisine? The cookbook will contain a lot of history and biblical connections, Schimmel enthused. It will reflect a beautiful coexistence over food.
If they reach their fundraising goal, Tasting Israel could be available by October 2022.

'We try to stay apolitical'
Politics has no place in the Artza project, Schimmel stressed. 
He described himself as a modern Orthodox Jew who grew up in London with an Israeli mother and an English father. As a child, he would often visit his maternal grandparents and cousins in Israel. Staying connected to Israel was a very important part of his childhood.
Thats what drives his vision for the Artza boxes, the Artza tours and the forthcoming cookbook.
We try to stay apolitical, he stressed. Were looking for the connection that people have to the land. Our subscribers are pro-Israel. The soul of our business is to serve people who want to connect to Israel. We help them bring the Bible to life in a meaningful way.
Schimmel uses Christian consultants to make sure their content is culturally sensitive.
Acknowledging that, most Christians are not going to come to Israel, Schimmel said his company stands out from other Israeli gift box companies because of their emphasis on all the supplemental materials that connect their subscribers to the city or region each box represents.
The support weve gotten from Christians has been incredible and overwhelming, Schimmel added. Our members are staunchly pro-Israel, with such a strong connection. We want to reciprocate that and give back as well.
We are here to invite you to a real meaningful connection with Israel, he concluded.",box-planner,product launching & presentation,executive statement,company description,,

I am excited to work closely with this group of investors to pursue our vision for improving the fertility experience. Most of our investors are parents (three of them LGBTQ parents), each with their own unique fertility journey. So they bring not just capital, but an authentic connection and desire to push our mission forward and help others start families, said Halle Tecco, Founder and CEO.
With plans to expand its offering of evidence-based products and educational resources, Natalist is positioned to grow its reach in the family planning arena. Specifically, Natalist is in the R&D phase with a few additional products including products specifically designed to cover the needs of women with particular conditions like PCOS and endometriosis, as well as exploring products addressing male fertility.
Natalist supplements
Natalist
This November the company also plans to launch Parent Plans, a guided book and journal covering topics from conception to parenting philosophies. Natalist will offer a version of the book for LGBTQ couples that explores topics and concerns unique to this group.
An Often Difficult Journey Many Can Relate To
Aileen Lee, from Cowboy Ventures, highlights her passion to improve this space: From my own experience, I know how confusing and outdated existing fertility products and offerings can be. The Natalist team is well positioned to redesign what it means to start a family. Im proud to be an investor and join them on this mission.
Julia Cheek, CEO of EverlyWell, at-home lab-testing company that raised $50million last April, said: Its an incredibly exciting time in the womens health space, and particularly in fertility where women and their partners are proactively sharing their fertility journeys and looking for communities like Natalist to support them. As a new mom myself, Im excited to back the Natalist team to support others embarking on what can be a lonely and emotional process for many women.
Christine Lemke, Cofounder and President of Evidation Health, a Series C health technology and service company that helps innovative life sciences and healthcare organizations understand how everyday behavior impact health outcomes, emphasizes the big opportunity in this space. My fertility journey, along with many others, is fraught, confusing, and full of unreliable and under-researched information. This creates a compelling opportunity in multiple dimensions its a large and unformed market, and when the problem is addressed, Natalist can positively impact families everywhere.
The group not only recognizes the urgent need to deliver better support to future parents during their fertility journey, but also the lack of personalized product selections and evidence-based educational resources for the various groups of people who have different needs, and is committed to continuing their efforts in this direction with this funding round.

549,Nurses: State hospital is 'extremely unsafe' due to staffing shortage,"nurses there have raisedalarms about the ""extremely unsafe work environment'' that staff shortages have created.
The emails went out at a time of turmoil at the state-run Eleanor Slater Hospital. The
hospital's accreditation is up in the air
; a Department of Healthinvestigation is underway into the serious patient injury earlier this month and
theinterim ""chief medical officer' is days away from the end of her promised two-month stay and Dr. Sue Ferranti hadagreed to temporarily fill in.
In addition,Col. James Manni, the superintendent of the Rhode Island State Police, confirmed to The Journal, that the McKee administration alerted the State Police to be on standby, ""for security purposes only,'' on the night before the arrival of the potential hurricane Henri.
Confirming that this was the first time this had happened during his tenure, Manni said:
""We were contacted. They were short-staffed the night of the hurricane and they were making us aware they were short-staffed,'' in the event there was a problem in the hospital wing for court-ordered psychiatric patients.
Is there a staffing crisis?
One staff email obtained by The Journal described the broader problem:
""I am a nurse in Benton A...Whenever I express frustration with the way things are, I get told that everywhere else is the same, everywhere has staffing issues, there are always going to be difficult patients. And yes, that is true.
""But this is more than difficult patients. This is abuse,'' said the nurse, who asked that she not be identified by name, in her email to Richard Charest, the director of the state agency that runs the hospital.
""The acuity of the unit, the lack of medication, the dangerously low staffing levels&mldr;I cant say that there is one specific thing that can be fixed to improve things, but the combination of everything right now is a perfect storm. Someone is going to get killed.""
A second nurse wrote Charest a widely circulated email titled""Extremely unsafe work environment.""
Describing himself as a second shift nurse in the psychiatric wing, on the hospital's Cranston campus, he wrote:
""I sent this out on 8/15/21 and one week later we are being faced AGAIN with the extremely unsafe work environment. We need to increase the amount of staff immediately or someone is going to seriously get hurt one day.''
And once again, he noted, ""I have been frozen in, with no break on 2nd shift,'' heading into anothershift. (He too asked that he not be identified by name.)
On Tuesday, Melissa Ferrario, the president of the unions affiliated with the National Association of Government Employees that represent nurses on the hospital's Cranston campus, said:
""During the day they are supposed to have 4 RNs, three on (2nd shift) and at least two on 3rd,and they've gone down as far as two on days, two on 2ndand sometimes one on 3rd'' for more than 40 patients.
""There is definitely a shortage. There is no doubt about that,'' she said. ""It's across the board...but it's just that, that population is so dangerous that, of course, it is a little heightened.""
In response to a Journal inquiry, a spokesman for the Department of Behavioral Healthcare, Developmental Disabilities and Hospitals said Wednesday:
""DirectorCharest and BHDDH leadership are grateful to hospital staff for raising these staffing concerns, and the Director will work to resolve these concerns as quickly as possible.""
The current staffing numbers:""The hospital is down about 40 positions on the Cranston campus and about 20 positions on the Zambarano campus.""
As recently as a month ago, the Department of Administration provided this count of employees out of work, receiving workers compensation benefits for reported on the job injuries:
""As of July 17, there were 28 direct patient care staff and two non-patient care staff at Eleanor Slater Hospital (Pastore) receiving workers compensation benefits; there were five direct patient care staff and three non-patient care staff at Eleanor Slater Hospital (Zambarano) receiving workers compensation benefits.""
Asked if this represented a staffing crisis,the spokesman, Randal Edgar said:
""There is a national shortage of direct care workers...Stress from COVID has had an impact, some workers are on leave, some have resigned, and healthcare providers are all looking for replacements from the same pool of workers.""
""We expect that being able to use additional staffing firms will help ESH navigate staffing challenges.""
More specifically, he said the agency ""sought and received state approval to work with additional staffing agencies that provide direct care workers, as well as one additional agency that provides security personnel.''
BHDDH also confirmed the interim appointment of Dr. SueFerranti as the chief medical officer, until a permanent replacement is hired.
""Dr. Ferranti has worked at the hospital since 2005, serving as 1) Medical Director, Respiratory Services, and 2) Physician Administrator. Her specialty is pulmonary services/internal medicine,'' Edgar said..
Ferrario, the president of the NAGE local on the Cranston campus,had what she considered a positive conversationwith Charest on Tuesday.
""I know there are a couple of moves they are trying to make,'' she said, including bringing a second security company - and hiring ""agency nurses'' as an interim step, with union approval.
The Rhode Island Department of Health had not, as of Tuesday night, completed its investigation of an August 10 incident, in which a patient used a utensil that had not been retrieved by assigned staff after a meal, to seriously injure his eye.
Three employees on the Cranston campus were ""disciplined"" for the lapse that enabled a patient to injurehimself.

552,Two products changing the game for brassica growers,"Email
Consistently producing successful forage brassicas is a juggling act; a fine balance of multiple factors, any one of which has the potential to damage your crop and derail your season. Of these varying factors, one of the most critical is weed control.
The goal of any weed control program is a relatively straight-forward one protect the crop by reducing competition for light, moisture and nutrients. The most effective control comes from a dense crop canopy, making rapid emergence, growth and establishment a key consideration.
Corteva Agriscience has earned a reputation as the 'Brassica Protection Specialists', developing a full suite of herbicides designed to alleviate the stress and eliminate the guesswork involved in weed control. Two of those products in particular Korvetto and Milestone have become essential resources for local growers.
Korvetto with Arylex Active - is an innovative herbicide that's highly-effective against some of New Zealand's most invasive weeds, including Fathen, Nightshades, Shepherd's Purse and Fumitory. It also delivers unparalleled flexibility, with its short plant back periods allowing farmers to plant clover just three months after application, and fodder beet after six.
SUPPLIED
A well-managed and established forage brassica crop.
Korvetto has an excellent crop safety profile across brassica varieties, and a built-in MSO adjuvant, making it easy to use with no need for the addition of wetting agents.
Milestone is the ultimate solution for hard-to-control weeds, with its advanced, high-strength formulation proving devastating to the likes of Spurrey, Amaranthus , Water Pepper and California Thistle. Improved crop safety, combined with reduced packaging and handling requirements, have helped make it a staple on farms right around the country.
The efficacy of Corteva Agrisciences' products has much to do with the company's blend of local knowledge and global expertise. Operating for over 75 years in New Zealand, they've been developing and producing sustainable weed, pest and disease control solutions and gaining a peerless understanding of everything from the local conditions to the needs of Kiwi farmers.
Those insights are backed by the resources and reach of their parent company, an international leader in seed technologies and crop protection solutions. Considered the world's only agri-science innovator that is solely focused on agriculture, the organisation invests heavily in research and development, striving to 'protect and preserve the source of the world's food'.

553,Spineology Provides Duo System Commercial and Post-Market Update,"BUSINESS WIRE
)Spineology Inc., an innovator in anatomy-conserving spine surgery, is excited to announce that over 125 lateral interbody fusion cases have been successfully completed using its unique Duo Lumbar Interbody Fusion System.
The Duo System features the only implant on the market that combines PEEK, titanium, and graft containment mesh elements. The implant, which is filled with bone post-insertion, creates a large, endplate-conforming graft pack that expands up to 30mm in width to maximize load sharing and minimize point-loading. These features are designed to reduce subsidence, improve spinal correction maintenance and support a robust fusion. In addition, the system significantly decreases the surgical access required to place the implant compared to traditional lateral systems. By minimizing the neural and soft tissue retraction typically required in these surgeries, Spineology believes the Duo System will reduce the retraction related post-operative complications commonly associated with the lateral approach.
One of the main issues weve heard from surgeons regarding monolithic implants is that they dont conform well to the concavity of the endplates, which can cause point-loading, potentially leading to subsidence and ultimately loss of spinal alignment, said John Booth, CEO, Spineology Inc. The Duo Implant was designed to address this issue by conforming to the endplates to provide a significant load sharing surface area, and we can deliver the implant through a very small access which we feel will have a positive effect on post-operative complications.
The company is currently conducting a prospective, post-market lateral interbody fusion study using the FDA-cleared Duo System, with over 75 study cases completed to date. Early clinical results from the study are extremely promising and demonstrate an excellent improvement in VAS and ODI scores, and a reduction in post-operative complications commonly associated with the lateral approach compared to the published literature.

Got it!

C
resco Labs, the Illinois-based cannabis producer, will acquire New York-based Columbia Care for $2 billion in an all-stock transaction.
If the deal is completed, Cresco will become one of the countrys largest cannabis producers and retailers with over 100 dispensaries across 18 states.
We couldnt be more excited, says Charlie Bachtell, CEO of Cresco. Its a unique opportunity to create industry leadership; it's a very important time with some sort of federal regulatory reform, we think, on the horizon.
Marijuana is still illegal on the federal level but 37 states have some sort of regulated market, with 18 allowing adult-use sales. Last year, legal sales totaled $26 billion in the U.S. and by 2030 the legal market will grow to around $65 billion, according to Cowen.
Nicholas Vita, the co-founder and CEO of Columbia Care, will join Crescos board but Bachtell is expected to lead the company.
Reuters first reported late Tuesday that the two companies were nearing an agreement.
The deal will have hurdles, including divesting a number of dispensaries and a few licenses in states where the two companies overlap, like Arizona, Florida, Illinois Massachusetts, New York, and Ohio. New York, where medical marijuana is legal and the states adult-use market is in the process of launching, is projected to be a $4.2 billion market within five years. Its a great opportunity where we do have overlapthey are incredibly valuable states that that people want to be in, so there's a good market for divestment, says Bachtell.
Columbia Care will expand Crescos presence to states like long-standing cannabis markets like California and Colorado, as well as states like New Jersey and Virginia, which have both passed adult-use but havent launched sales yet. We have the material markets of today, but [Columbia Care] has the markets of tomorrow, Bachtell says.
Under the terms of the deal, Cresco will acquire all the issued and outstanding Columbia Care shares. Columbia Care shareholders will receive 0.5579 of a Cresco Labs share for each Columbia Care share, which represents a 16% premium based on the closing price Columbia Care and 19% premium of Cresco Labs shares. Columbia Care shareholders will hold approximately 35% of Cresco Labs.
Since our founding, our mission has been to deliver the best outcome for our stakeholders, Vita said in a statement. In an evolving industry, the opportunities to better achieve our mission through consolidation led us to this historic moment.
Both companies are publicly listed in Canada due to the U.S. federal ban on cannabis. Columbia Care and Cresco have seen their stock prices crater 50% over the last year, but they are not alonethe entire industry has had difficulty keeping stock prices up as the U.S. government has not made meaningful progress in cannabis reform during the Biden administration.
The combined company will have the second-largest retail footprint in the industry after Trulieve. (Cresco has 49 dispensaries and Columbia has 99.)
The new company will also diversify the number of states in which the bulk of Crescos revenue comes from. Right now, 80% of its revenue is derived from Illinois, Pennsylvania and Massachusetts. If the deal closes, those states will only make up 50% of the companys revenue, with states like Colorado and Florida and New Jersey climbing up the list.
We focus on cannabis like the consumer packaged good that it is, and having access to 70% of the addressable market is how we turn our brand portfolio into the Miller High Life, Coca-Cola and Johnnie Walker Blue Label of cannabis, says Bachtell.

565,Alpine unveil 2022 F1 challenger,"LinkedIn
French manufacturer Alpine unveiled their 2022 Formula One challenger in Paris on Monday, becoming the ninth team to take the wraps off their car for the upcoming season ahead of the first winter test later this week.
The Renault-owned team's new A522 has been designed to the sport's radical new rules, with the cleaner, swept-back aerodynamics and larger 18-inch wheels, aimed at improving wheel-to-wheel racing.
It also features a revised livery, with the pink colour scheme of new title partner and water technology company BWT mixed in with the team's traditional blue.
Alpine's target is to fight for the championship within 100 races of the start of Formula One's new rules era, which will begin with the season-opening Bahrain Grand Prix on Mar 20.
""In 2022, we want to show constant progress with comprehensive developments across all sites to ensure we are contenders for the title in the future,"" said Alpine chief executive Laurent Rossi.
""We are going in the right direction and we want to carry on our climb to the summit.""
The outfit, who have finished fifth in the constructors' standings for the last three years, recently beefed up their technical department and last week announced the signing of former Aston Martin team boss Otmar Szafnauer as new team principal in a move aimed at reversing their plateauing form.
The team, who head into 2022 with an unchanged driver line up of double world champion Fernando Alonso and Frenchman Esteban Ocon, returned to the top step of the podium last season, with Ocon handing them their first win since the 2013 Australian Grand Prix in Hungary.
""I've had the displeasure of racing against these formidable competitors,"" said Szafnauer.
""I remember too well when they beat us in Hungary and didnt put a foot wrong,"" he said referring to Ocon's win ahead of Aston Martin's Sebastian Vettel who finished second on the road but was later disqualified for a fuel irregularity.
Alpine displayed a 2022 show car at their Paris event but released images of their actual car, which is currently being readied for the first pre-season test in Barcelona which gets underway on Wednesday.

570,Big changes at Seatara fine dining restaurant,"The seaside fine-dining restaurant  welcomes a new team to helm the kitchen
(photo credit: JONATHAN BEN HAIM)
Advertisement
Seatara has been a popular fixture in the upscale Sea & Sun complex for many years (its Jerusalem Post reviews extend all the way back to 2007). So when the announcement came that wholesale changes were being made to the winning formula, it was hard not to take notice.
The new chef, Oren Morad, certainly has the proper credentials: formerly executive chef at the luxury Setai hotel chain, more recently he worked at leading restaurants in France. He is being joined by a new pastry chef, Tal Mamalya, previously with the prestigious Tel Aviv restaurant Toto.
Seatara takes on a slightly different look in the winter. The elegant main dining room is unchanged, but the section that ordinarily affords an expansive view of the sea has all its windows blacked out by dark curtains. Stranger yet, strings of Christmas lights were strung in front of the windows, which were no longer transparent. And only this part of the restaurant had white tablecloths.
We were handed English and Hebrew menus, and an iPad. Only after we wasted some moments perusing the electronic menu were we told that it is all outdated, except for the sushi section.
In spite of the recent staff changes, the cocktail menu remains unchanged. Among the seven specially cocktails (NIS 46-58), we sampled the spicy passion. Based on two kinds of rum, this drink begins with a sweet start, which then tapers off to a spicy finish.
We eagerly turned to the food menu, after having read in the press release that chef Morad was introducing special dishes and stews from France and Spain through the end of March. Alas, we were doubly disappointed to get bad news on two fronts: first, the chef was not in the kitchen that evening; and second, there was not a hint of the much anticipated mouthwatering dishes anywhere on the menu, not even among the daily specials.
Determined to make the best of it, we asked the waiter which dishes on the menu were new, and learned that they were concentrated among the starters and the specials. Despite the bilingual main menus, the list of daily specials appears in Hebrew only.
The menu comprises six sections: Starters (NIS 54-78), Salads (NIS 54-69), Homemade Pasta (NIS 85-120), Pizza (NIS 72-85), Fresh from the Sea (NIS 115-145) and Meat (NIS 78-199, plus special cuts by weight). Interestingly, seafood appears in the first three sections only, and (unlike in the previous menu), not at all among the main courses.
cnxps.cmd.push(function () {    cnxps({      playerId: '36af7c51-0caf-4741-9824-2c941fc6c17b'    }).render('4c4d856e0e6f4e3d808bbc1715e132f6');  });
Similarly, vegetarian/vegan options are also confined to the first two categories  there is none even among the pastas. There is no pork anywhere; where bacon exists, it is made from lamb.
As we waited for our appetizers, we snacked on the warm focaccia, a particularly long and skinny version. It came with three ordinary dips and olives. Granted, Seatara is not an inexpensive restaurant, but NIS 39 for a finger of focaccia still seemed excessive.
Our first starter was the polenta with mushrooms, asparagus, lamb bacon and porcini oil. This was comfort food kicked up a notch: the creamy corn base, meaty mushrooms, al dente asparagus and smoky lamb bacon added up to an excellent dish.
Next was the grouper crudo  hefty morsels of raw fish in a brilliant emerald green soup of citrus gazpacho, winter-root salad and gremolata. The extreme freshness of the fish was evident even through the rather pungent sauce  which, frankly, did more to detract from the grouper than enhance it.
It was a little bewildering to see two categories of quintessentially Italian food in a restaurant that is not defined as Italian. But there are only three dishes in each category, and some of the pastas and pizzas did seem different from the usual Italian fare.
In particular, the tartufo gnocchi sounded promising: pillows of potato pasta in a sauce of chestnut cream, mushrooms, nuts and white truffle paste. Sadly, the texture of the gnocchi was dense and sludgy, and the sauce uninspired and unremarkable.
Turning to the main courses, the fish category contained some intriguing sounding dishes, while the meat category seemed rather pedestrian  heavy on options like kabab and pullet, staples of simple neighborhood fast-food joints. But the daily specials included an irresistible cut of beef: prime rib from Nebraska.
The 800-gram steak, meant for sharing, was duly impressive, covering the wooden platter from end to end. Unfortunately, the prime rib was overcooked, making the beef drier than it should have been; this actually made us a bit angry  that the kitchen would be so careless with this beautiful steak. Still, the superb quality of the meat managed to shine through a bit, and it was no problem polishing it off.
By this time, the non-upholstered chairs were taking their toll, forcing us to stand frequently to relieve the pressure of having to sit on hard, uncompromising wood.
The international wine list is more than adequate, with a reasonable selection available by the glass. The restaurants private collection is a real eye-opener, with vintages ranging in price from NIS 517 to a whopping NIS 3,456.
The entirely new dessert menu presented us with difficult choices (NIS 52-56). La chocolate was a chocolate extravaganza consisting of chocolate cake topped with chocolate cream, alongside caramelized bananas, mascarpone cream and tuile de cigarette, while the speculaas cake was actually a mousse of cheese and white chocolate atop a thin cookie, with almond crumble, red pear, caramel sauce and blondie ganache. There was a lot going on in each dessert, but once again, I thought they were a feast more for the eyes than the palate.
Unfortunately, we will never know for sure whether the meal that fell short of expectations was the fault of the absence of the chef or not.

So what
Revenue in the fourth quarter increased 28% to $39.1 million, slightly ahead of the consensus estimate of $38.9 million. That resulted in adjusted net income of approximately $400,000, or $0.01 per share. That bottom-line result was right on target compared to what Wall Street analysts were modeling for. The technology company which provides network intelligence and security services, said maximum annual revenue (MAR) potential of concluded transactions reached $192 million for 2020.

""Threats on the internet are on the rise and growing numbers of consumers and operators see the need for Network based protection.""
Now what
Guidance for 2021 was a little light, however. Revenue this year is forecast in the range of $145 million to $150 million, while the consensus estimate currently sits at $155 million in sales. Allot expects to close more recurring security deals with MAR of $180 million in 2021.

593,"Dominion has a secured, sustainable water supply","Save
Water is life in the West, and the key to economic growth and quality of life in Colorado!
Theres no question that big problems exist, and creative and thoughtful solutions are whats needed to reduce water usage, especially as the Front Range population continues to grow and water becomes an even more precious resource.
You may have seen several references in publications such as Colorado Politics and The Denver Gazette which stated that Dominion Water and Sanitation District (Dominion), and more specifically, Sterling Ranch is a likely recipient of water from a proposed Renewable Water Resources project in the San Luis Valley. Nothing could be further from the truth.
Dominion, the water district we lead with a diverse, talented staff, in partnership with the Sterling Ranch Community Authority Board, designed a water system and implemented water demand management to be sustainable from the beginning of this thriving new community.
The CAB developed and has successfully implemented a water demand management strategy that dramatically reduced the water its residents use to less than 30 percent of what Douglas County requires of new development.
Dominion, which serves the CAB, existing communities on declining wells and potential future customers in the greater northwest region of Douglas County, has already acquired all the renewable water needed for the planned Sterling Ranch Community at its full buildout. This has been accomplished through renewable water owned on the South Platte River and working collaboratively with Denver Water, Aurora Water, and the South Metro WISE Authority to establish formal agreements. All these purchases and contracts were in place before a single home was built in Sterling Ranch. For these reasons, and many more, Dominion, Sterling Ranch, and the CAB, do not need, the San Luis Valley water.
Dominion is leading the way in solving the Northwest Douglas County regions water and wastewater challenges. To this extent Dominion, the Town of Castle Rock, and Plum Creek Water Reclamation Authority have submitted a proposal to receive federal funds for a regional wastewater and water solution along the Highway 85 Corridor. This proposal will solve regional water quality issues, provide wastewater transmission services, and supply municipal water to stranded communities who rely on declining and low-quality groundwater.
Dominion has already built an extremely robust water supply portfolio capable of supporting Sterling Ranchs full build-out for its maximum density which includes:
Renewable water through the WISE Partnership:
Renewable water on the South Platte River
Return flows delivered via the South Platte River
Groundwater as a back-up for drought conditions
Rainwater harvesting (the only District or Water Utility legally allowed to implement utility scale rainwater harvesting)
Storage in Chatfield Reservoir
Aquifer storage and recovery to replenish the aquifer from withdrawals during drought
The CAB has implemented demand management by:
Requiring every homes landscape design to be reviewed and approved for water conservation prior to installation
Dual water metering for indoor and outdoor usage and assigning a higher rate to outdoor usage
Requiring every home to use an irrigation system with evo-transpiration data and is manufactured by a local Colorado company: Rachio
Worked with the Denver Botanic Gardens to develop a landscape palette for residents
Most importantly water demand management is being embraced by the public and the residents of Sterling Ranch. To this extent, Sterling Ranch has had the highest number of home sales for a Master Planned Community in the Denver market for two years in a row, and in 2021 was ranked as one of the top planned communities in the United States according to the National John Burns Report.
Lets be very clear, water is a severe challenge in our state. One that can only be solved by myriad proactive efforts led by experts to simultaneously develop robust and reusable water systems while also stretching every drop as far as it can take us.
We believe that Dominion, CAB, and Sterling Ranch have done this, and we look forward to continuing to lead the way in water sustainability along the Front Range.

610,Canadas SecureKey to be bought by Avast,"Print
Canada is about to lose ownership of one of its best-known cybersecurity firms.
SecureKey Technologies, an identity and authentication provider whose services are used by the Canadian government and leading financial institutions for login verification, has struck a deal to be bought by Czech-based antivirus provider Avast.
Its Verified.Me is a mobile app that leverages a users bank credentials for digital identity verification for a wide range of services. In Canada, that includes secure login to a number of government departments including Canada Revenue Agency (CRA) and Employment and Social Development Canada, or securely buying commodities through TD Banks Precious Metal digital store.
Last year Interac Corp., which runs a payment network here used by major credit card companies, acquired the exclusive rights to SecureKey technologies in Canada.
The companies said today they expect the deal to close early next month. No purchase price was announced. Best known as a provider of consumer antivirus for individuals and small businesses, Avasts acquisition of SecureKey now gives it a foothold in the business market
The maturity of the SecureKey hybrid federation, bank ID, and decentralized technology suite and history of strong operational delivery in Canada for discerning financial services and government customers and partners positions Avast for geographic expansion, Charles Walton, Avasts general manager and senior vice president for identity, said in a statement. Walton used to be SecureKeys chief executive officer (CEO).
As the European community is investing in public-private sector digital identity infrastructure in 2022 and beyond, we see Avast well-positioned as a collaborative provider of digital trust services for people, digital businesses and government. Success for us is where digital identity becomes simple, user-centric and portable, and can enable a more trustworthy digital experience and deeper online engagement benefiting both people and business.
Avast has been buying companies for a while to bulk up in the highly competitive cybersecurity market. In 2016 it bought competitor AVG Technologies for US$1.3 billion. Last year it announced a deal to merge with Norton Lifelockfor US$8 billion, however, it hasnt been consummated yet. The U.K.s anti-trust regulator has some concerns Since this acquisition is on hold, Avast decided to go ahead with its acquisition of SecureKey.
Avast said it had adjusted revenue of US$892 million in 2020.
SecureKey CEO and founder Greg Wolfond said in a statement that combining forces with Avast enables SecureKey to innovate further and faster with its technology.
Wolfond is an entrepreneur who has co-founded and sold several companies. Among them was Footprint Software, a maker of financial applications for banks, sold in 1995 to IBM; and 724 Solutions a maker of messaging solutions for wireless carriers, which went public in 2000. 724 Solutions was bought by California-based Mobixell Networks in January 2010.
Wolfond began to step back from running SecureKey in 2012 when Charles Walton was named CEO.
At the time, Wolfond said hed be concentrating on working with SecureKey customers and on the companys technology. He added he was not thinking about the next company hell create, nor selling or taking SecureKey public. But he returned as CEO in 2016.
Now he will report to Walton.
Its a funny turn of events, Wolfond said in an interview this morning. His return as CEO came as the company turned to a distributed identity model that gives consumers control over the use of their personal data for secure ID, explained.
Walton joined Avast last summer, Wolfond said. Late last year talks began on whether SecureKey would be a good fit for it.
Wolfond will stay with the SecureKey division for as long as theyll have me. He described the acquisition as a win for Canada rather than the loss of a technology firm.
Its difficult to conquer the world organically with a team of 110 people who are resident in Canada he said. So how do you get it going in Indonesia, Germany, France and all of these places? Its a speed to market and capability thing.
Its a pretty big boost and pat on the back for Canadas technology. We built this out, we got it working, we gave Interac an exclusive licence in Canada, and this is folks coming in and saying, We love what youre doing. Lets take this out globally.
We stay here  all the data, all the people stay in Canada. We continue to make Interac a showcase, and then we take the technology to the world. Its pretty fantastic.
He also expects the deal will allow the SecureKey division to hire more staff.
We envisage a global and reusable digital identity framework which will underpin a new trust layer for the internet, said Ondrej Vlcek, CEO, Avast. Its clear that digital identity is the critical enabler for many digital services and SecureKeys success reflects the growing demand for this from consumers. SecureKey is highly complementary to Avasts prior work in Identity and together we will take our offer to the next level, accelerating innovation and working to establish a user-focused, global approach that aligns user, business, and government propositions.
Forrester Research senior analyst Paddy Harrington said the acquisition is a strong move by Avast to expand. Theyve been seen by many as a useful free antivirus solution for a long time, with a pay-for upgrade, so expanding into the digital identity and authentication market will show theyre growing as a company and providing more value. By expanding the reach of the SecureKey technology, they could bring this solution to more users and businesses and help provide that trusted authentication solution that a lot of users want when theyre online.
This does raise questions though, as Norton has interest in merging with Avast. While this has been put on hold to answer some concerns on the competitive side, if allowed to go through, youd be combing the AV, VPN, privacy monitoring, and now digital identity of these companies together and that could change the combined solutions into a powerful endpoint protection solution.
This story has been updated with comments from SecureKey founder Greg Wolfond, Forrester Research, and Avast CEO Ondrej Vlcek

Revealed: the dangerous chemicals in your food wrappers
Tests by Consumer Reports found PFAS in all kinds of food packaging, even from companies that say theyve phased out the chemicals
by
Kevin Loria of Consumer Reports
Thu 24 Mar 2022 10.15 GMT
Last modified on Thu 24 Mar 2022 15.16 GMT
Independent testing of more than 100 packaging products from US restaurant and grocery chains identified PFASchemicals in many of the wrappers, a Consumer Reports investigation has found.
The potentially dangerous forever chemicalswere found in food packaging including paper bags for french fries, wrappers for hamburgers, molded fiber salad bowls and single-use paper plates.
They were found in the packaging from every retailer CR looked at, including fast-food chains  such as Burger Kingand McDonalds and places that promote healthier fare, such as Cavaand Trader Joes
CR tested multiple samples of 118 food packaging products and found evidence of PFAS in more than half of those tested, while almost a third had levels beyond a threshold supported by CR experts and others.
Food packaging at or above 100 ppm
In recent decades, PFAS exposure has been linked to a growing list of health problems, including immune system suppression, lower birth weight and increased risk for some cancers.
PFAS can be found not only in nonstick pans and waterproof gear but also in the grease-resistant packaging that holds food from takeout chains and supermarkets. A seemingly virtuous alternative to plastic, packaging made with PFAS often resembles paper or cardboard but salad dressing and fry oil do not leak through.
We know that these substances migrate into food you eat, said Justin Boucher, an environmental engineer at the Food Packaging Forum, a non-profit research organization based in Switzerland. Its clear, direct exposure.
Thats especially likely when food is fatty, salty or acidic, according to a 2021 reviewin the journal Foods. Some research even suggests that PFAS levels are higher in people who regularly eat out.
Another concern: when packaging is tossed into the trash it can end up in landfills, and PFAS can contaminate water and soil, or it is incinerated, and PFAS can spread through the air.
Health and environmental advocates have been pushing for PFAS use to be restricted, especially in items such as food packaging. In response, some fast-food and fast-casual restaurants, as well as several grocery stores, say that they have taken steps to limit PFAS in their food packaging or that they plan to phase it out.
In CRs tests the chemicals were also found in packaging from places that claimed to be moving away from PFAS, though those levels were often lower than at other retailers. We know from our testing that it is feasible for retailers to use packaging with very low PFAS levels, said Brian Ronholm, director of food policy at CR. So the good news is there are steps that companies can take now to reduce their use of these dangerous chemicals.
How PFAS gets from food packaging to you
Searching for PFAS
The first known PFAS in the US was accidentally discovered in 1938 by a 27-year-old chemist named Roy Plunkett and in the decades since it and related chemicals have been added to a wide variety of products to make them resistant to heat, water, oil and corrosion.
Today, these practically unbreakable compounds, created when the elements carbon and fluorine are fused, can be found in the air and the water, as well as in our bodies our food, and our homes
Identifying the exact type of PFAS in a product is complex: there are more than 9,000 known PFAS, yet common testing methods can identify only a couple dozen.
So CR tested products for their total organic fluorine content, which is considered the simplest way to assess a materials total PFAS content. Thats because all PFAS contain organic fluorine, and there are few other sources of the compound, says Graham Peaslee, PhD, a professor of physics, chemistry and biochemistry at the University of Notre Dame in Indiana, who has studied PFAS in food packaging.
Another complication: PFAS is used so widely  found in ink on food containers, recycled paper, machines that make packaging and more  that it often shows up in products unintentionally.
Scientists and regulators are still debating what level of organic fluorine indicates intentional use. California has banned intentionally added PFAS; starting in January 2023, paper food packaging must have less than 100 parts per million organic fluorine. Denmark has settled on 20ppm as that threshold, a limit supported by CRs experts as well.
If they can get to 100ppm, they should be able to get to 20ppm, Peaslee says. Lower is always the ultimate goal.
CR tested multiple samples of 118 products and calculated average organic fluorine levels for each. Overall, CR detected that element in more than half the food packaging tested. Almost a third  37 products  had organic fluorine levels above 20ppm, and 22 were above 100ppm.
Among the 24 retailers CR looked at, nearly half had at least one product above that level, and most had one or more above 20ppm. But almost all also had products below that amount. For example, while the two products with the highest average levels came from Nathans, the chain also had four products below 20ppm. Nathans told CR that it was redoing its packaging and had eliminated the high-level items, as did Chick-fil-A, which had the item with the next highest level in CRs tests.
The results of the tests are not representative of all the packaging from a retailer, and packaging may have changed since CR conducted them.
Putting PFAS claims to the test
CR looked at retailers that claimed to be phasing out PFAS, including Cava, Chipotle, Panera Bread, Sweetgreen, and Whole Foods Market.
All 13 of the products the companies said had reduced PFAS still had some detectable organic fluorine, and seven were above 20ppm. They ranged from a Whole Foods soup container with 21ppm organic fluorine  the only Whole Foods item to exceed the 20ppm limit  to a paper bag for pita chips from Cava with 260ppm.
In response to questions from CR, companies stressed that with PFAS so common in the environment, its almost impossible to eliminate them entirely. Sweetgreen, for example, said, We may have trace amounts of fluorine in our bowls. Unfortunately, PFAS are a widespread problem and are present in everyday life from tap water to air to soil. Whole Foods said the company does not make PFAS-free claims but has strived to prevent intentionally added PFAS in packaging. Panera and Chipotle also said their goal was to avoid packaging with intentionally added PFAS.
Cava said that supply chain problems had slowed its transition to eliminating added PFAS. The company said that it hoped to complete that process by the end of 2022 and that it had updated its public statements to reflect the new timeline.

616,Royal Caribbean Makes a Huge Change Customers Will Love,"BMW Hit by News That Could Slow Its Efforts Against Tesla
1 hour ago
Having five ships in the class gives Royal Caribbean a lot of freedom when it comes to how it uses those ships.
Now, while it's still using four of the five Oasis-class ships for longer itineraries, it plans to deploy Allure of the Seas to Port Canaveral Florida starting in late 2023 where it will offer three- and four-day sailings, Matt Hochberg of the Royal Caribbean Blogfirst reported.
""In recent years, Royal Caribbean has steadily improved the vessels offering weekend cruises from Florida, beginning with amplified Voyager Class ships, and more recently the slightly larger Freedom Class ships,"" wrote Hochberg, who has no affiliation with Royal Caribbean. ""
Allure has been operating longer cruises out of Galveston, Texas, but will be replaced in that market by Harmony of the Seas in late 2022.
Why Should Carnival Fear This Change?
Both Royal Caribbean and Carnival operate multiple ships running short Caribbean itineraries out of ports on Florida's eastern coast.
Royal Caribbean already has a couple of edges when it comes to those trips.
First, it has the more developed private island, with an added-fee water park and a huge pool, while Carnival's island is basically a beach. Second, Royal Caribbean arguably already had nicer, newer ships with more bells and whistles, and bringing in Allure makes that difference much-more pronounced.
Royal Caribbean and Carnival compete for the same customers and having a newer ship in its top-tier class may give Royal an edge.
It may also allow the company to capture a higher ticket price for passengers on Allure while offering more modest fares on its slightly smaller ships sailing out of Fort Lauderdale and Miami.
Giving customers a short taste of Allure a ship so big you can't experience it all in three or four days may also help Royal Caribbean sell longer trips on the rest of its Oasis-class ships. That might take further booking away from Carnival, where consumers might otherwise have opted to try Mardi Gras or Celebration. Tags",Oasis,product launching & presentation,company description,,,

618,Singapore company to start clinical safety trials in humans for potential COVID-19 treatment,"LinkedIn
SINGAPORE: A Singapore-based company will start human clinical trials next week for a treatment that could slow down the progression of COVID-19 in patients, help them recover faster, and provide temporary protection against the coronavirus.
In a media release on Wednesday (Jun 10), Tychan, a Singapore-based biotechnology company, said it has received approval from the Health Sciences Authority (HSA) for the Phase 1 clinical safety trial in healthy volunteers.
The firm has developed TY027, a monoclonal antibody that specifically targets SARS-CoV-2, the coronavirus that causes COVID-19. Monoclonal antibodies can be isolated and manufactured in large quantities to treat diseases.
Presently, there is no proven antibody-based treatment for COVID-19. There is also no licensed vaccine to prevent SARS-CoV-2 infection, Tychan said.
Tychan may become the first firm to start its human clinical trial in Singapore, although efforts in developing an antibody-based treatment are underway here and globally. As of Tuesday, Tychans was the only registered clinical trial internationally for such a treatment.
Depending on the results of the trial, there are various ways it can be used, said Professor Ooi Eng Eong of Duke-National University of Singapore (Duke-NUS) Medical School, who is also the firms co-founder.
READ: Ebola drug remdesivir conditionally approved for COVID-19 treatment in Singapore
DRUG COULD BE USED IN VARIOUS WAYS DEPENDING ON TRIAL RESULTS
You could use it to treat all COVID-19 patients and prevent them from getting severe disease. You could also give it to those who are going to get severe disease and prevent them then from sliding further in their respiratory function, he said.
For those who already require oxygen, the hope is that the drug will prevent them from needing a ventilator, and for patients who are already on ventilators, that they could go off the ventilators, he added.
If the treatment works for COVID-19, then we could change a lot. We could reduce a lot of problems that we face, he said, noting that patients with severe disease need oxygen and ventilators, without which they would die.
We hope that this treatment that we have will reduce the number of people who go into such severe disease and hopefully, the number of people who die of COVID-19 becomes minimal, he said.
The drug will also be evaluated for its potential to provide temporary protection against infection with SARS-CoV-2, Tychan said.
We could even, for instance, give this to healthcare workers who are treating COVID-19 patients so that they don't get infections themselves, Prof Ooi said, adding that this would depend on the results of the trial.
People traveling to places with many COVID-19 cases could also use the drug to prevent infection, he said.
PHASE 1 TO LAST ABOUT SIX WEEKS
Doses of the monoclonal antibody will be administered by blood to 23 healthy volunteers, and the research team will then evaluate its safety. The Phase 1 trial, to be conducted by SingHealth Investigational Medicine Unit, will take about six weeks to evaluate the safety and tolerability of TY027, Tychan said.
The potential treatment was developed in partnership with the Ministry of Defence, Ministry of Health, the Economic Development Board and other Government agencies as part of a whole-of-Government effort.
Upon reaching the key milestones of the Phase 1 trial, Tychan will seek approval from HSA for TY027 to be administered to a larger population of volunteer patients in subsequent trials to establish the efficacy of the monoclonal antibody, it said in its statement.
TY027, made on Feb 25, was identified as the most promising among several monoclonal antibodies that demonstrated 100 per cent neutralisation against live SARS-CoV-2 viruses in the lab, Tychan said.
It has also successfully completed pre-clinical safety studies and other regulatory requirements, including a three-week drug stability test. These were all completed in less than four months before this first-in-human infusion, Tychan said.
This is an important milestone for drug development against infectious diseases, Prof Ooi said, adding that getting into clinical trials usually takes about two or three years.
However, he cautioned that many drugs fail at clinical trial stage and do not get licences.
There's still a lot of work for us to do, he said.
""Rapidly developing a cure for COVID-19 is exactly the raison detre of Tychan,"" said chairman of the firms Board, Teo Ming Kian.
Whilst still a few months away from knowing if we are successful, we are hopeful because of our experience in Zika and Yellow Fever. No efforts will be spared to continue the fast pace of development as we are conscious that a day saved is a day less of misery.""",Tychan,clinical trial sponsorship,regulatory approval,executive statement,,

Daniel Craig's 007 may not have a successor just yet, but Amazon is moving quickly to get the world of the iconic character back to screens. Prime Videois moving forward with a brand new reality competition series that will incorporate the themes and locations of James Bond as contestants race around the world to try and win big money. Think of it like The Amazing Race with a lot of James Bond influence.
According to Variety Amazon has given the green light to the first season of 007's Road to a Million. Longtime Bond producers Barbara Broccoli and Michael G. Wilson are going to be producing the new series alongside Britain's 72 Films and MGMTelevision. Production is set to begin later this year and casting is currently underway.
Chosen contestants will compete in pairs to try and win 1 million ($1.3 million) in cash. There will be physical challenges throughout the competition, as well as mental puzzles and mysteries that must be solved in order for a team to take home the prize.
Amazon made headlines this year by completing its $8.5 billion purchase of MGM the longtime production home of James Bond. Seeing as how the company now has control of the character, it's likely we will be seeing a lot more Bond in the future. That said, 007's Road to a Million has reportedly been in the works for some time, with development starting before the MGM deal was made.
""I first had this idea over three years ago,"" 72 Films CEO David Glover told Variety. ""Dan Grabiner and the U.K. Originals team took it to a whole other level.

627,Maine health systems say they've lost up to 5% of staff due to the state's COVID-19 vaccine mandate,"1:39
MaineHealth
The state's largest health systems say they have lost between 2% and 5% of their workforce due to the Mills Administration's COVID-19 vaccination mandate for healthcare workers. Enforcement of that statewide mandate began on Friday, and some health systems have been affected more than others.
Portland-based MaineHealth, which is the parent company of Maine Medical Center and several other hospitals across the state, says it lost two percent of its workforce to the mandate. That's similar to the figure reported last week by Bangor-based Northern just 191 employees.
""The staff is evenly split between clinical and on-clinical. It's about 50/50. But we have been planning for this for awhile, and although things are very tight from a labor perspective, we don't expect to scale back any of our health services,"" says
Chuck Hayes, CEO or MaineGeneral Health.
Hayes says MaineGeneral is offering incentives to staff to pick up extra shifts. It's also recruiting volunteers to temporarily fill non-clinical roles.
Lewiston-based Central Maine Healthcare, attributes the loss of 156 employees, just over 5%, to the mandate. The losses prompted CMH to temporarily suspend inpatient pediatric admissions and its special care nursery last month, and officials say that suspension will continue. Central Maine Medical Center's ICU is not operating at full capacity, its trauma service is evaluated daily, and the hospital has had to postpone some elective surgeries.
MaineHealth, the parent company of Maine Medical Center, says it lost roughly 2% of employees. The latest figures from Northern Light Health report a similar loss.

We have almost twenty months to evaluate alternative uses for the facility before GSA vacates the building. At the lease termination date of
November 1, 2023
, management estimates that the facility will be almost debt free which provides significant financial flexibility. Security West's manager has expressed confidence that, based on current markets conditions and other factors, there should be demand for Security West's space either from other government departments represented by GSA or from private sector tenants or investors. Moreover, a new long-term tenant could facilitate obtaining new financing on the facility. We will keep our shareholders updated about future developments at Security West.""

$25

May 2020
and thereafter a thirty-year amortization schedule. The facilities were purchased via a joint venture with SSCP Management LLC (""SSCP""). Pursuant to the terms of the joint venture, Regency earns a 7.5% per annum preferred distribution on its
$11

$210,576
reflecting the 7.5% per annum preferred distribution driven by the strong ongoing operating performance of the investment. Surplus cash over and above the 7.5% per annum preferred distribution is retained within the venture. We remain pleased with the continued strong occupancy and related cash flows at our self-storage facilities.""
""We are continuing to review and evaluate further investment and cost reduction opportunities for Regency and intend to grow the company by acquiring or otherwise investing in other attractive long-term businesses that meet our investment characteristics and valuation criteria.""

630,Mr Kipling sets sights on US market after exceedingly good trial in Canada,"Tue 16 Nov 2021 19.04 GMT
Last modified on Tue 16 Nov 2021 21.34 GMT
Mr Kipling is heading to the US in January with chocolate and salted caramel cakes after a successful trial in Canada.
Owner Premier Foodsannounced the move as it recorded a slide in sales and profits in its main markets over the last six months, with shoppers returning to dining out and overseas deliveries hit by shipping problems.
The British maker of French fondant fancies and Bakewell slices said Mr Kipling is also widening its range into biscuits and ice-cream for the first time while Premier is also planning Angel Delight and Ambrosia custard flavoured ice-cream, as it extends its well-established brands into new areas.
The international expansion comes despite a 5% fall in sales overseas for the group, which also owns Oxo and Bisto, compared with a year before as shoppers returned to more normal behaviour after repeated lockdowns. Deliveries to Australia and North America were also delayed by problems with global shipping.
The company said it expected to spend 25m in the year as a whole as it invested in its supply chain to improve efficiency.
Shares in the company slid just over 4% as it said total sales fell 6.5% to 394m in the six months to 2 October and pretax profits fell 39% to 30.7m as shoppers reined in spending at supermarkets and cooking at home to spend their money in restaurants, cafes and workplaces. However, half-year profits were just over double those before the pandemic.
Premier Foods said it had been able to successfully manage and navigate challenges from widespread supply chain disruption, including a shortage of lorry drivers and cost inflation, and was on track to deliver profit expectations for the year.
It said the cake market had been less affected by big changes in consumer behaviour during the first year of the pandemic while the Covid-related costs had reduced.
Alex Whitehouse, the chief executive of Premier Foods, said price rises for shoppers were likely next yeargiven higher raw ingredient prices on commodities such as sugar, dairy and wheat. However, he said the company was looking for ways to be more efficient and cut costs to offset inflation.
Sign up to the daily Business Today email or follow Guardian Business on Twitter at @BusinessDesk
Whitehouse said the company intended to pay shareholders a full-year dividend for the second time in over a decade. The payment comes as pretax profits were held up by a steady trading performance and significantly reduced interest costs after the firm cut its debts and refinanced the remainder so it was paying lower interest rates.
I am particularly pleased with how well the business is successfully navigating the widely reported industry wide-challenges including logistics, labour shortages and input cost inflation to deliver such a strong set of results, which again underlines the robustness of our operating capabilities, he said.
Analysts said sales and profits at Premier were ahead of expectations.
The pandemic has helped revivethe company which spent years struggling with heavy debts and pension liabilities Clive Black, an analyst at Shore Capital, said Premiers debt reduction was liberating the group from financing costs and so allowing for greater investment in innovation and marketing which had helped it gain market share.

641,"Proprietary pot: Cannabis trademarks aren't legal, but workarounds exist to protect IP","Trademarks illegal, but workarounds exist
Many waiting out the clock for federal legalization
Patent litigation is heating up
ILYAST VIA ISTOCK
Many cannabis companies and their attorneys are making bigger bets on cannabis trademarks amid swaying opinion that the drug should be federally legal.
The state's largest marijuana grower plans to launch a line of edible gummies this fall without enough tetrahydrocannabinol, or THC, to get you high.
Dimondale-based Green Peak Innovations will launch its branded Jolly Edibles as a CBD-only product, meaning it contains less than 0.3 percent THC. While CBD products are popular, the choice has more to do with protecting its branding than selling gummies.
The U.S. Patent and Trademark Office bars trademarks on illicit products. Marijuana remains a Schedule 1 narcotic at the federal level, despite being legal for use in Michigan. This presents a tricky scenario for the state's legal marijuana companies seeking to protect their intellectual property.
Green Peak, like many others in the industry, is enforcing its protections in as many ""workarounds"" as possible, local experts say.
Special Report: IP Law
What's driving the uptick in IP litigation?
""We're forced to get somewhat creative,"" said Jeff Donahue, general counsel for Green Peak. ""We've had a few (trademark) denials, so we're crafting some specific language with the USPTO. We're taking a look at all of our products that could fall under the legal threshold for trademark and establishing our name everywhere we can.""The plan is to trademark as much of Green Peak's product line as possible and make new products under brand names that are under the THC limit to appease federal authorities.
Jennifer Hetu
Jennifer Hetu, trademark attorney and partner at Honigman LLP in Bloomfield Hills, said cannabis companies should be filing trademarks on everything and anything they can, including branded tchotchkes and non-cannabis merchandise.
""You want to get as many protections as possible as broadly as possible,"" Hetu said. ""File for ancillary products and services. File applications for clothing, hats, bags, stickers, lighters, rolling papers. Although not squarely in your space, it provides you protection of that brand name.""
Green Peak sells T-shirts and other items with its North Cannabis brand, which is the physical marijuana product distributed to retail locations.
But many sophisticated companies and their attorneys are making bigger bets on cannabis trademarks amid swaying opinion that the drug should be federally legal.
Under USPTO rules, companies can file intent to use trademark applications on a cannabis product without identifying to the federal regulators that it is for cannabis. The USPTO gives applicants three years to provide documentation of the product's use.
""You can file a real buttoned up application where the mark doesn't reference anything related to marijuana or cannabis and just wait,"" Hetu said. ""Effectively, you're running out the clock on purpose waiting for (federal) legalization.""
Green Peak is employing this strategy as well, Donahue said.
""That's the strategy for sure,"" he said. ""Keep things pending for as long as you can through the process. From an application point, it's a gray area. So if we're first to market, we're making sure our brands are visible before it's legal at the federal level.""
Green Peak Innovations
Green Peak's Skymint-branded marijuana flower.
Marijuana companies can also file trademarks at the state level, which holds some water legally, but cannot be used to battle infringement from outstate operators, which is more likely to be the problem, Hetu said.
For this reason, many large marijuana companies are attempting to establish a brand presence in as many legalized states as possible. Green Peak acquired cannabis vaporizer maker Evoxe Laboratories in California earlier this year to expand its operations, but also to expand its branding.
""From a strategic standpoint, we want to be a multi-state operator,"" Donahue said. ""We're doing this not specifically for the trademark issue, but clearly you get there by having brands that are defensible in many states.""
Patent protection the USPTO does not require a product be legal to achieve a patent is heating up in the cannabis industry as well, said Thomas Southard, partner at Butzel Long PC in Washington D.C.
""We've been seeing major companies file for patents related to cannabis in recent years,"" Southard said. ""Patents are always very valuable but we're seeing they are very valuable in this space as the industry will likely see lots of (mergers and acquisitions) in the future.""
Biopharmaceutical giant GW Pharmaceutical has filed dozens of cannabis-related patents, mostly tied to CBD products. So has Janssen Pharmaceuticals and even the National Institutes of Health.
Cannabis companies can file patents on growhouse modifications, specialized equipment for transporting cannabis, automation for harvesting marijuana and even the chemical formulas for the strains of marijuana.
""I liken it to the start of the auto industry,"" Southard said. ""Think of all the streamlining and advancements in manufacturing. The same is going to happen in cannabis. Patents are going to be very powerful assets in the future.""
Patent protections are already going to court. In July 2018, Golden, Colo.-based United Cannabis Corp. sued Conifer, Colo.-based Pure Hemp Collective Inc. for patent infringement over its CBD product formula. The case remains ongoing.
""Lawsuits are coming in now as companies are correctly protecting their investment in intellectual property,"" Southard said. ""It's only going to grow as the industry matures.""
Southard said many small independent marijuana businesses don't protect their patents because it's costly, but warns that it may be costlier not to.
""At some point, someone might infringe upon your IP,"" Southard said. ""A lot of small companies have never been involved in patent litigation and it's costly. But there are options.""
Southard estimates a patent protection suit can cost from $1 million to $3 million in many cases, but that litigation finance companies are often a smart way for smaller companies to combat infringement.
These companies underwrite the litigation for a portion of the recovery if the suit is ruled in the plaintiff's favor.
""File patents,"" Southard said. ""Don't be lazy and let the competition overtake you. Always think of newer and better ways to build the mousetrap. This industry is expanding and more competitive; you've got to protect your turf.""",Green Peak Innovations,regulatory approval,executive statement,,,

A plethora of filings opposing GeoBroadcast Solutions proposal to allow FM boosters to geo-target programming and advertising led the company behind the technology to respond and defend itself.
GeoBroadcast Solutions spokesperson Robert Udowitz said opposition to new technologies and innovation is a familiar story for those whove watched broadcast media evolve over the decades. Udowitz says, the proposed rule change will enable those broadcasters who want to use technology to pursue radio geo-targeting, which we see as the entryway to a potential trove of economic improvement and business opportunities for each broadcaster.
Udowitz says he recognizes some parties only see complexities and challenges with this new technology. We see potential and the ability for the radio industry to finally join other media in the 21st Century to bring more targeted content and enable advertisers to reach specific audiences. The net result has great potential to promote localism, and to improve the balance sheet of the industry and we are excited to work closely with the industry to address the benefits and concerns.",FM Solutions,executive statement,,,,

Twitter is rolling out Community creation and testing 1080p video uploads
Twitter started as a very basic social media platform for sharing ideas and news through no more than 140 characters. The service started to evolve slowly, bringing new features and increasing the character limit in the process. Lately, the company has been introducing plenty of new changes some of which are exclusive to Twitter Bluesubscribers. For example, Labs is a new section that is exclusive to paying users, where the company tests beta features. The latest addition to Labs is support for 1080p video upload on the desktop website. Paying mobile users will possibly get access to this addition at a later date. Apart from that, Twitter is rolling out Community creation to all users paying or otherwise. Prior to this, those interested in creating a Community had to fill and submit a form to the company.
Community creation
We have discovered a new plus (+) icon in the Communities tab both on mobile and desktop. This button allows users to create a new Community by providing a name and an optional purpose. Its still unclear if this is a regional rollout or a global one. Weve been able to spot this change in several countries across different platforms, though. This eliminates the need to submit a request to Twitter and wait for approval.
Those who have received this feature via this server-side rollout will see a new banner mentioning that the wait is over. For the unfamiliar, a Community is similar to a Facebook Group. When a user joins one, they can tweet to other members of the same Community. Interestingly, these tweets dont appear on a users profile/timeline. Theyre simply exclusive to the Community theyve been posted to.

670,The global wellness economy stands at $4.4 trillion amidst the disruptions of COVID-19; Is forecast to reach $7 trillion by 2025,"0
0
New Global Wellness Institute researchthe most in-depth in its historyreveals that the wellness market grew to a record $4.9 trillion in 2019 and then fell to $4.4 trillion in the pandemic year of 2020. But with a consumer values shift underway, the future of the wellness market is incredibly bright, predicted to grow 10% annually through 2025.
BOSTON, MA  The nonprofit Global Wellness Institute (GWI)unveiled its much-anticipated research report, The Global Wellness Economy: Looking Beyond Covid, which provides new global market data on the overall wellness economy and for each of its eleven sectors. The 100-page report answers the big questions: How did the shock of COVID-19 impact the wellness industry? Which wellness markets fared best and worst? What is the future of the wellness economy - and why?
The GWI last measured the wellness industry at $4.3 trillion in 2017, and the new research reveals that it grew to historic levels in the two years before the pandemic, reaching $4.9 trillion in 2019. With the massive economic shocks from COVID-19, the global wellness economy fell 11%, to $4.4 trillion, in 2020. But with the pandemic ushering in a major shift in values for consumers, governments, and the medical worldwhere prevention and wellness take on far greater importance - the GWI predicts that the wellness market will return to pre-pandemic levels in 2021 ($5 trillion), and will grow at an impressive 10% annual pace through 2025, when it will reach $7 trillion.
The report, released today at the Global Wellness Summit in Boston, is the GWIs most in-depth research on wellness markets ever: For the first time, it provides detailed numbers and analysis for all eleven wellness sectors: pre-pandemic, pandemic, and future growth rates; rich regional and national data; and the major trends that will impact each sector post-COVID.
This research update is crucial, because 2020 is the watershed year that will forever divide historyand the trajectory of the wellness economyinto before and after COVID-19, said Ophelia Yeung, GWI senior research fellow. When we analyze how different wellness markets performed in the last year, its natural to want to compare them and label winners and losers. But there is no question that wellnessas a concept, as a lifestyle priority, and consumer valueis a big winner from the pandemic.
Key findings:
The momentum for wellness is evident in the strong pre-pandemic growth rates for every sector between 2017 and 2109, where each market hit a record valuation. In those years, the wellness economy grew 6.6% annually, a significantly higher rate than global economic growth (4%). In the pandemic year of 2020, the wellness economy contracted by 11%, nearly four times more than the declines in global GDP (-2.8%). Unsurprisingly, sectors requiring a physical presence and/or full immersion for the actual experience, including physical activity, wellness tourism, spas, and thermal/mineral springs, saw the biggest pandemic declineswhile healthy eating/nutrition/weight loss, wellness real estate, mental wellness, and the public health/prevention/personalized medicine category all showed strong pandemic growth.
For the first time, the research breaks down the total wellness economy for each global region. Asia-Pacific was one of the fastest-growing wellness markets from 2017 to 2019 (8.1% growth), and it also shrank the least during the pandemic (-6.4%). Conversely, North America was the fastest-growing wellness region from 2017 to 2019 (8.4%), but among the hardest hit by the pandemic (-13.4%).
Asia-Pacific had the largest wellness market in 2020 ($1.5 trillion), followed by North America ($1.3 trillion), and Europe ($1.1 trillion). Per capita spending on wellness is significantly higher in North America ($3,567) and Europe ($1,236) than in other global regions.
The wellness economy will grow an extremely robust 60% from 2020-2025, with most segments projected to exceed GDP growth across those years. Markets with the highest growth projections (wellness tourism, thermal/mineral springs, spas) are those that took the greatest hits in 2020. Sectors that showed positive pandemic growth, including wellness real estate and mental wellness, are forecast to see powerful, ongoing market expansion.
Wellness Market Snapshots:
Wellness Tourism (pandemic loser, future winner): Grew 8% annually from 2017 to 2019 (reaching $720 billion) and then took a major hit in 2020. The market shrunk -39.5% to $436 billion, while wellness trips dropped from 936 million to 601 million. The impressive 21% annual growth rate projected for wellness tourism through 2025 reflects new traveler values (a quest for nature, sustainability, mental wellness) as well as a period of rapid recovery from pent-up demand in 2021 and 2022.
Thermal/Mineral Springs (pandemic loser, future winner): One of the fastest-growing wellness markets from 2017 to 2019, with revenues rising from $56 billion to $64 billion (6.8% annual growth). Hit hard by the pandemic, revenues fell -39% in 2020, shrinking the market to $39 billion. There are now 35,099 hot springs establishments across 130 countries. The downturn is temporary: Very strong 18% annual growth is expected through 2025, with 140-plus new projects in the pipeline.
Spas (pandemic loser, future winner): From 2017 to 2019, the spa industry was growing at a fast 8.7% annual rate and reached $111 billion in revenues across 165,714 spaswith a big jump in hotel/resort spas (from 48,248 to 60,873). The high-touch industry got hit hard in 2020: Revenues fell by -39% (to $69 billion) and spa establishments dropped to 160,100 (with a loss of over 4,000 day spas). But the industry is expected to recover fast, with the market growing 17% annually through 2025, and more than doubling revenues (to $150.5 billion).
Wellness Real Estate (pandemic and future winner): With COVID-19 dramatically accelerating the understanding of the role that the built environment and our homes play in our physical and mental health, the wellness real estate market was the #1 growth-leader both before and during the pandemic: The market grew from $148.5 billion in 2017 to $225 billion in 2019 to $275 billion in 2020 (22% annual growth). Wellness residential projects (either built or in the pipeline) skyrocketed from 740 in 2018 to over 2,300 today. Wellness real estate will continue its growth surge: The market will double to $580 billion from 2020 to 2025 (16% annual growth).
Physical Activity (pandemic loser, future winner): This six-sector market grew 5% from 2018-2019 (to reach $874 billion), but revenues fell 15.5% in 2020 (to $738 billion). The fitness subsector (gyms, studios, classes) suffered a severe -37% revenue decline in 2020. Fitness technology was, of course, the bright spot, exploding 29% in 2020 to become a $49.5 billion marketwith digital apps, streaming and on-demand workout platforms surging 40%.

Data: Meet ad creative
From TikTok to Instagram, Facebook to YouTube, and more, learn how data is key to ensuring ad creative will actually perform on every platform.
Medisafe
, a startup developing a personalized medication management platform designed to help patients stay on top of their prescriptions, today announced that it raised $30 million. The company says this new investment will enable it to expand its solutions while accelerating revenues growth.
Fear of or discomfort from needles are among the many reasons patients refuse to take or keep up with medications. According to a
review
in the Annals of Internal Medicine, 20% to 30% of medication prescriptions are never filled and approximately 50% of medications for chronic disease arent taken as prescribed. This lack of adherence is estimated to cause approximately 125,000 deaths and to
cost the American health care system
between $100 billion and $289 billion per year.
In 2012, Medisafe cofounders Omri Shor and Rotem Shor, who are brothers, faced a family health emergency. Due to a miscommunication about his medication schedule, their father, a diabetic, accidentally took an extra dose of insulin. In an effort to address and prevent these sorts of mistakes from happening in the future, the brothers created Medisafe, which helps to manage prescription schedules by leveraging AI and big data.
Medisafe employs what it calls digital drug companions to ensure medication takers follow through with their prescriptions. After a patient enters a medication into Medisafes smartphone app, the app guides them through a process that entails collecting release forms and helping them through titration schedules. Powered by Medisafes predictive AI engine, the Just-in-time-Interventions (JITI), the apps content changes as the patient matriculates through therapy and recovery, delivering instructions on how to administer medication, assessing eligibility for financial support programs, and ordering refills as well as collecting information for providers via surveys.
Medisafe can email and text patients to remind them to take their medications on time. Moreover, the platform can target rising-risk patients with analytics and insights based on real-time behavioral assessments, boosting adherence up to 20%.
With AI integration, users friends and physicians can be alerted if a user has missed doses, when specific steps have not been completed, or when a patient has some kind of challenging event throughout their journey, a spokesperson told VentureBeat via email. Through [Medisafes] platform, the company delivers average adherence rates by users of 86%, well above industry norms of 50%. Billions of successful medication doses are managed through Medisafes platform, preventing more than 500,000 potentially harmful drug-to-drug interactions.
On the backend, Medisafes in-app Care Connector enables clinicians to remotely connect with patients should they need additional assistance. And the companys Maestro product provides a summary of patient census, compliance configuration settings, access to program reporting, and integrations with other vendor data.
While Medisafe directly competes with Walmarts CareZone, Shop Apothekes MyTherapy, TrialCards Mango, and Healthprize, it claims to be among the largest medication management platforms in the world with over 7 million registered users. Over the past eight years, through partnerships with pharma companies including Merck, the company has amassed a database of over four billion dosage behaviors informing JITI.
Todays investment allows Medisafe to expand holistic treatment support for patients to impact behavior change and ultimately outcomes. Medisafe is continuously advancing its technology to meet the dynamic needs of patients managing complex therapies, Omri Shor said in a press release.
Sanofi Ventures and Alive Israel HealthTech Fund led Medisafes series C funding announced today, which had participation from Leumi Partners, Menorah Mivtachim, and Consensus Business Group, as well as previous backers Pitango Ventures, 7Wire Ventures, Merck Ventures, Octopus Ventures, Lool HealthTech, Triventures, and OurCrowd. It brings Israel- and Boston, Massachusetts-based Medisafes total raised to date to roughly $55 million.

684,On the podcast: The new PE behavioral health play,"Thanks for having me.
Rebecca:
I want to give both of you a chance to introduce yourselves a bit and talk about your perspective on the behavioral health space and where that comes from. Avi, maybe you can go first. Why don't you give us the elevator pitch for Sonara?
Avi:
Oh, fun stuff. Yes. I'm Avi. [I] founded Sonara in my fourth year of medical school. The reason we founded the company is because right now we live in a pretty remarkable world. You can get anything delivered on Amazon that you want within 48 hours. You can send Jeff Bezos to space, but for some of the most vulnerable in the addiction communityspecifically those addicted to very severe opioidsto get quality treatment, they need to get methadone and they have to go into the clinic every single day to get this treatment for the first few months that they initiate treatment. Then they stay on the drug for quite a while after that, still having to come to the clinic very regularly.
In this world where everyone else can get stuff delivered to their door in 48 hours, we thought there should be a way to get this drug delivered to their doors, or at least taken home in a safe and dignified manner. We came up with a technology platform to help these patients do that, to help clinics keep better track of their patients when they're at home and to just optimize things for everyone involved in this workflow specifically, which is just so highly unique in medicine.
Rebecca:
Avi, you're an M.D. What made you want to found a company rather than practicing medicine?
Avi:
Oh man, that was totally by accident. ... I met my co-founder just taking an elective course in psychiatry actually. I [had] just finished applying for plastic surgery residencies and I want[ed] to learn more about other types of medicine just before I went and shipped off to the operating room, ostensibly for 90 hours a week for forever. I met Michael, he had this cool idea, and we just rolled with it.
We picked up a bunch of momentum as the year went on. Then once we started getting some serious investor attention, validating things in the market and getting some customer attention, I saw the writing on the wall. I'd had a lot more fun doing this than I had wanting to train to be a doctor. I thought I could make a bigger impact in propagating healthcare technology out to the world, rather than the individual patient-to-patient perspective that you get just when you're in the operating room [and] you're physically limited by what you can do with your hands. I decided to make the jump.
I wouldn't recommend it for most people, but I think we had a pretty cool idea at hand and the ability to help a lot of people quickly. I wanted to strike fast and I suppose I can always go back to medicine if this doesn't work out. It's been a great ride ever since.
Rebecca:
Yes. Love it. Dexter, why don't you introduce yourself and introduce us to The Braff Group?
Dexter:
Thanks Rebecca. The Braff Group is a boutique M&A advisory company that focus exclusively in healthcare services. One of our primary verticals these days is behavioral healthcare, which has just exploded over the past five years and then exploded even further in the most recent two as it relates to what's happened with COVID.
As we all know, COVID has been very, very difficult on the collective mental health of our country and other countries as well. As a result of that, investors are rightly identifying that whatever streak behavioral health had been on prior to COVID, it's now even greater because of the expectations of increased utilization predominantly in mental health services.
Unfortunately in the servicesnot unfortunately because of Avi's company, unfortunately because of the need for interventions for substance use disorderI think it was well-documented last year that there were 100,000 deaths from opioid addiction, which was absurdly high and the need for intervention on addictions and substance abuse disorder is astonishing.
Within the behavioral health area, we look at five different primary segments within that. That's mental health, substance use disorder, which is what Avi's company is involved with predominantly, intellectual and developmental disabilities, programs that target at-risk youth and then autism services, which has also exploded in the last four or five years.
Rebecca:
That's great. With that higher-level view, can you just set the scene for our listeners in terms of what kind of private equity activity we're seeing across behavioral health and some of the economic dynamics that we're seeing in the space?
Dexter:
Well, let's just say it's good to be a sell-side intermediary right now in behavioral health. I'm looking at our data over the last 10 years. In 2021 we were able to identify 251 aggregate behavioral health transactions. In the previous year, which was a new record in 2020, was 189. [That's a] 33% increase in the number of transactions done in the behavioral health space from 2021 versus 2020.
The other thing that we note is that within behavioral health, if we look at the percentage of deals being done by private equity versus the percentage of deals being done by strategic players in particular in behavioral health, there's a substantially higher percentage of deals being done by private equity sponsors than there are by strategic players. That includes both platform transactions and follow-on transactions.
Rebecca:
Yes, pretty remarkable. I want to bring in this regulatory and policy context as well, because this has been in the news lately, the last State of the Union address included an emphasis on behavioral health. We're seeing some movement at a really bipartisan basis at the state level around this space. I'll start with you on this Dexter, but Avi, feel free to jump in. How's the political landscape shaping the investment dynamics that we're seeing right now?
Dexter:
Sometimes it's unfortunate when you're talking about something like behavioral healthcare, where people are really struggling. Then you talk about it from an investor standpoint. The reality of it is that the regulatory environment could not be any better than it is for behavioral health. Now, when I say that [it] doesn't mean that there can't be improvements.
What I mean by that is that the openness with which Congress and federal state and local governments are looking at providing services to people suffering from mental health and behavioral health issues has just never been better. There's a real emphasis on trying to find new and creative ways, both for people to access behavioral health services and to have them funded.
It's really politically incorrect at this point to be voting against things that are going to improve access to behavioral healthcare. From that perspective the acceptance is just so favorable. It had been getting better under the Affordable Care Act where President Obama expanded the regulations that required that private insurance reimburse behavioral healthcare services on par with what they were reimburs",Behavioral Dimensions,executive statement,company description,,,
685,In-Vitro Diagnostic Regulations (IVDR) Transition,"Ivdr transition
IVDR - NEW EC REGULATION
The Regulation EU 2017/746 (IVDR) replaces the positive list approach with new classifications rules, as defined in Annex VIII. These classification rules define 4 different levels of risk classes (from the lowest risk class, i.e. class A, to the highest risk class, i.e. class D), based on the clinical risk profile of the IVD. As a result, all currently marketed IVDs and newly developed IVDs will need to be re-classified according to the new rules, and their conformity assessment re-defined based on the risk class.
The re-classification is expected having an unprecedented effect in the IVD industry, as most of currently self-certified marketed IVDs will need to be assessed for the first time by Notified Bodies in order to remain in the market. The estimated outcome of this process is a reversal of the current regulatory framework, i.e. moving from 80% of IVDs under self-certification according to IVDD to 80% of IVDs requiring the involvement of the Notified Body for assessing the conformity to IVDR.
Many manufacturers, which did not have in their product portfolio List A or List B IVDs, will have to contact for the first time a Notified Body, for Technical Documentation assessment of their re-classified IVDs and, possibly, for the first certification of their Quality Management System according to ISO 13485. Critical suppliers of these manufacturers will have to meet the additional requirements set by the IVDR, and may be exposed to unannounced audits by Notified Bodies. Distributors will have to follow the additional requirements set by the IVDR too.
On the other side of the fence, Notified Bodies designated under the IVDD are 22, and their internal resources have been sized to accommodate the need of a small portion of the IVD industry, i.e. the List A, List B and devices for self-testing, which corresponds to roughly 20% of the whole IVD industry. Hence, as a result of the shift in the classification of IVDs, the 22 Notified Bodies and their internal resources may already not be sufficient to meet the demand of about 80% of IVDs requiring the involvement of a Notified Body according to the new Regulation.
Furthermore, Notified Bodies need to be re-designated under the new Regulation, and in this process not necessarily all Notified Bodies will be able to maintain the same scopes, covering for all IVD applications. As of today, a limited number of Notified Bodies is designated under the new Regulation: the up-to-date list of IVDR designated Notified Bodies can be consulted in Nando section of the European Commission website.
Therefore, considering, on the one hand, the expected increase in the demand by the IVD industry for Notified Bodies and, on the other hand, the probably limited availability of Notified Bodies designated under the IVDR with a full scope, the bottleneck for the CE marking of currently marketed IVDs as well newly developed IVDs will indeed be the assessment of the Technical Documentation by Notified Bodies in order to receive the EC certificate.
Finally, according to Article 110 of the IVDR, a soft transition period is defined from May 2022 to May 2024 for IVDs which have placed in the market under the IVDD prior to May 2022 by virtue of an EC certificate.
However, most of the currently marketed IVDs do not hold an EC certificate, as they have been placed on the marked under self-certification. Therefore, as a secondary effect of the shift in the classification of IVDs, most manufacturers of IVDs will not be able to implement a soft transition up to 2024; instead they will need to apply in full the new Regulation starting from May 2022.

Review of the existing safety and performance data for compliance to the GSPR, as defined in Annex I of the IVDR;
When applicable, strategic planning for grouping, i.e. definition of product families, based on intended use and/or working principle of the IVD, to be implemented for the review process by the Notified Body.
Moreover, one of the major changes brought by the European In Vitro Diagnostic regulation is the requirement of a Performance Evaluation Report (PER). Medidee may:

688,"One Month of Learnings from Flo Healths Bug Bounty Program: A Q&A with CISO, Leo Cunningham","LinkedIn
The CISO of Flo Health, the worlds most popular womens health app, knows that enabling his security team with the most advanced security testing methods is of the utmost importance to brand trust and user loyalty.
We recently sat down with CISOLeo Cunninghamto hear about Flo Health's learnings from the first 30 days of their bug bounty program. Read on to see what Leo shared about the importance of leveraging the global hacker community and how vulnerability findings help improve Flo Health's internal processes.
Tell us who you are.
Hi, Im Leo Cunningham, the CISO at Flo Health.
What does Flo Health do? Why is cybersecurity so important?
Leo Cunningham: Flo is the most popular womens health app globally; over 190 million users have downloaded Flo, attaining 40 million monthly active users. With over 80+ medical experts, Flo supports women during their entire reproductive lives. The app provides curated cycle and ovulation tracking, personalized health insights, expert tips, and a private community for women to share their questions and concerns. Flo Health app is available in more than 20 languages on iOS and Android.
Flo prioritizes safety and keeps a sharp focus on being the most trusted digital source for womens health information. Cybersecurity is the most important thing to our business due to the sensitive data we process and the large amount of user data we store.
What led you to HackerOne?
Leo Cunningham: Before using HackerOne, we used to run penetration testing via a vendor. However, these traditional pentests limited us because we couldnt access niche skill sets. We wanted to add a modern approach to what we were already practicing. Choosing HackerOne means were not limiting ourselves. We can open up our application and platform to the largest global community of ethical hackers. We wanted to reach a diverse community and pool of talent to push the boundaries, give us a better measure of our security, and detect vulnerabilities that could have been missed internally. By offsetting some of our vulnerability management and testing efforts, we have saved ourselves a huge amount of time and money.
What were some of the first successes?
Leo Cunningham: Launching the HackerOne program has allowed us to look at our internal processes and refine these to ensure maximum ROI and efficiency when dealing with multiple sources of vulnerability information.
In the first month of the program, we reached out to 200 people on the platform to see if they could test what we already put in place. So far, we have had a couple of items disclosed. One of the bugs disclosed so far was a low vulnerability. This bug was already known to our security team and is a legacy item with no impact on Flo. Because the bug bounty submission was from another perspective, we decided to pay $200 for this as it was insightful to know how a hacker viewed this vulnerability.
The interaction with the HackerOne team and with the hacker community has been great. HackerOne Triage verifies the findings before being submitted to us for review. This saves Flo so much time and reduces our efforts on checking items.
How are hackers helping you reduce business risk?
Leo Cunningham: The hacker community is assisting us in achieving a position where we are as secure as we can be while allowing the business to operate as usual. This also helps us review current processes, Jira workflows and makes developers aware of security bugs.
A hacker finds a bug - what happens next? Leo Cunningham: Once a bug has gone through HackerOne triage, we first fully validate the vulnerability ourselves, then add this to our vulnerabilities project, and if eligible, a bounty is paid out. From there, the relevant metadata is added, and the bug is sorted into a list of prioritized items to get fixed according to our internal SLA structure for remediation. The bug is then fixed and closed.
How do hackers help you spot vulnerability trends across your attack surface?
Leo Cunningham: Hackers can spend more time across a wide range of areas to understand our technology and product, then apply their niche skillset to help us paint a picture of any issues that need to be addressed, ultimately helping us maximize our ROI.
What advice would you give to other CISOs planning to start a bug bounty program?
Leo Cunningham: If you havent already, set up a formalized internal process to deal with items in an orderly fashion. Make sure your teams are ready to understand and remediate upcoming issues. Think about what you want to get from the program and implement your plan accordingly.
How do you quantify working with hackers? Leo Cunningham: Working with the hacker community allows us to receive bugs that are not seen in traditional penetration tests and gives us a larger window of time in which to find these bugs. HackerOne provides the largest community of ethical hackers in the world, which makes it the best and biggest resource out there. The more hackers there are reviewing our items, the better.
Each company is different and has different needs, but in order to quantify working with hackers, I ask myself the following:
What do I currently spend on external penetration tests, and what level of coverage do I get? If I want exposure to a large community of hackers who live and breathe security testing, would this option give me more scope on tests for my product?
Am I time-boxed with internal or external testing? If so, this adds additional pressure when you can freely open up your product (within a restricted and secure space) and allow hackers to take their time and spend longer on testing.
Having a bug bounty program is great from the brand perspective. It shows the world that you are investing in security and that you are open to a varied and wide community of testers who dedicate their time finding security bugs that could seriously impact your company if found by a malicious hacker.
Q: How do you measure the value of data security?
Leo Cunningham: At our core, we are a platform that relies on very sensitive data, and our customers need to be able to trust us with this information. Like all companies, a data breach has the potential to cause a lot of damage. Flo, as a result, has a very strong focus on security at all levels, and HackerOne is a crucial part of this process.
Whats the biggest lesson youve learned so far?
Leo Cunningham: Be prepared to deal with all sorts of information from various skill sets and keep an open mind.
What does success look like in the future for you?
Leo Cunningham: Success for us will be when we are getting minimal bugs reported, penetration tests return little to no results, and our internal vulnerability count is minimal.
Anything else youd like to share?
Leo Cunningham: The HackerOne customer service and account management team have been world-class.",Flo Healthcare,company description,executive statement,,,
692,Jacksonville Beach vaccination company Health Hero fans out across state to deliver Covid shots,"Editor in chief, Jacksonville Business Journal
Apr 6, 2021
A Jacksonville Beach company specializing in mass vaccinations will be deploying to sites across the First Coast beginning this week as part of a $2.7 million state contract to deliver Covid-19 vaccinations.
For the past month, teams with Health Hero Florida have been fanning out across the state, bringing mobile Covid vaccination operations to primarily rural and other underserved communities.
In the first four weeks, weve delivered 15,000 vaccinations in markets that most likely would not have been touched or reached, company President Jeff Lott told the Business Journal last week.
In normal times, Health Heros job is to deliver vaccinations in schools. Over the past nine years, the company has operated in 14 states, including Florida, running pop-up vaccination clinics that the company says have provided over a million flu and MMR vaccination shots to students.
The contract with the state to provide Covid shots came out of contacts the company had developed through its years of working with school districts. In March, Gov. Ron DeSantis announced Health Hero would be implementing a pilot program in Highlands, Glades, Levy, Putnam, Dixie and Gilchrist counties.
Our mission remains clear: We are ensuring that every senior who wants a shot, gets a shot, DeSantis said at the time. Through this pilot program, we hope to significantly expand vaccine availability in underserved communities in our states most rural counties.
The company is now active in more than a dozen counties, with Duval, Clay and Nassau launching this week.
The company has been employing about three dozen nurses; as more counties are added, that number is growing.
Working through local health departments, the teams go out to places like rural senior centers  areas where there is a sizable group of people, but one that might not have transportation to existing vaccination operations.
A lot of the federal dollars have been going to these big pods. Its these oulying areas that havent been reached, Lott said. We were awarded this because of our mobility and our ability to go anywhere.
The state contract runs through this month, but Lott said Health Hero is looking to continue the work as long as it's needed.
Its other focus: bringing its mass vaccination operations to private employers and other large groups.
Now that the age group is going down to 18, well find ourselves in a lot more of those conversations, Lott said. Were just waiting for the regulations to change.

Firstly, all employees of Aico, and sister company, Homelink, have been gifted membership to the charitys well-established lifesaving lottery scheme, giving them a weekly chance to win 1,000.
This also means the total sum raised in weekly lottery membership will fund two air ambulance missions per year.
Neal is also taking part in the MAAC Moguls campaign, a Dragons Den-style challenge, which will engage young people across the Midlands with the lifesaving work of the pre-hospital emergency service, by testing their fundraising and entrepreneurial skills.
Matthew Small, finance director for Aico also took part in the charitys recent jail or bail event which saw him receive punishments and spend the night in a cell at Shrewsbury prison for petty office crimes.
With the support of the whole Aico team, Matthew raised in excess of 2,600, funding one of the charitys air ambulance missions.
Neal said: We are all committed to giving back to the community and we actively seek to support good causes wherever possible. As well as having the privilege of recently becoming a trustee for Midlands Air Ambulance Charity, supporting the service with its strategic goals, I am also passionate about supporting its daily critically-important missions.
Pam Hodgetts, corporate partnerships manager for Midlands Air Ambulance Charity, added: Aico truly is in the business of saving lives. We are excited to have the team on-board as corporate partners and look forward to supporting the whole team through our mutually beneficial partnership.
It is thanks to the generosity of local people and companies like Neal and Aico that we are able to make our daily missions possible.",Midlands Air Ambulance Charity,alliance & partnership,support & philanthropy,executive statement,,
700,Refurbed partners with Irish tree planting project,"Online marketplace Refurbed has partnered with Irish tree planting project Reforest Nation to help rebuild native woodlands and offset carbon emissions.
The partnership, which has been announced to coincide with National Tree Week, will see Reforest Nation join Eden Reforestation Project as a key part of the companys goal to counteract any CO2 emissions produced as a result of the refurbishment of its electronics.
Customers buying a refurbished device from the website will be able to choose Ireland as a country in which to plant a tree as part of the process.
Eden Reforestation Projects plants trees in countries including Haiti, Indonesia, Kenya, Madagascar, Mozambique and Nepal.
Refurbed plants a tree for every product it sells; the company said in 2021 it has planted 1 million trees, with more than 25,000 from Irish customers who have bought refurbished technology in the past year.
The announcement is particularly timely as National Tree Week is recognised in Ireland this week. Reforest Nation is on an ambitious mission, and I am thrilled that refurbed can be part of their journey to make a real difference across Ireland and beyond, said Peter Windschhofer, chief executive and co-founder of Refurbed.
Irish consumers have contributed significantly to the number of trees we have planted in the past year, and we hope in 2022 that this number will increase further. This partnership will also allow Irish consumers to have a positive impact on the native reforestation efforts in their home country.
Founded in 2017 by Mr Windischhofer, Kilian Kaminski and Jrgen Riedl, Refurbed employs more than 150 people and operates in Ireland, Austria, Germany, Italy, France, Sweden, the Netherlands and Denmark.
Refurbeds refurbishment process includes a 40-step procedure to return products to factory condition before they are sold. The tree planting offsets the emissions from this process.
Reforest Nation are doing tremendous work in trying to revitalise Irelands forestation and this was a natural fit for Refurbed in terms of matching our goals, mission and values as a whole, said Pdraig Power, Refurbeds marketing manager for Ireland. Along with our other markets, Refurbeds objective is to get one refurbished device into every household in Ireland. We believe that with the shift to a circular economy, people will be more conscious of their purchases, particularly electronic devices such as smartphones, laptops, and tablets. With the option to assist in the redevelopment of our forest lands, I believe people will be drawn to this new partnership with Reforest Nation in helping our country face the challenges of fighting climate change.
Reforest Nation has a goal of planting one million trees by 2024 to help restore biodiversity and fight climate change. The organisation has planted 35,000 in Ireland since it was established in 2020, with a further 75,000 in Africa, Asia and central America.
I am excited to welcome Refurbed as an ecosystem level planting partner of our organisation as we aim to achieve our target of planting one million trees by 2024, said Gearid McEvoy, founder of Reforest Nation. Our goal is to make an impact in the world with the restoration of biodiversity and I know this is something which is shared with the team at refurbed. They are doing some outstanding work in making customers aware of the circular economy, particularly with day-to-day or modern must-need products such as smartphones, tablets and laptops amongst others. I believe together, we can work to make a big difference not only amongst consumers, but also in the physical landscape of this country.
The Government previously announced plans to plant 440 million trees for 2040. Ireland currently has 11 per cent of land covered with trees, with only 2 per cent of that consisting of native trees.

706,Former executive linked to Michael Flynn is founder of company awarded $48 million Air Force contract in 2019,"3 min read
A former executive linked to Michael Flynn, who was CEO of a Flynn Intel Group subsidiary in 2016 when Flynn contracted with Ekim Alptekins Inovo to investigate Fethullah Gulen  is founder of a company that was awarded a $48,843,831 Air Force contract in September 2019.
Note: there is no indication Michael Flynn is linked t
o
the $48 million contract or that there is anything unusual about the award. The company that won the contract had prior links to Flynn and the contract includes development of electronic warfare/cyber network attack software and hardware systems, and given the sensitive cyber responsibilities, is worthy of further research.
Tim Newberry was CEO of Flynn Intel Group (FIG) Cyber in 2016 when Flynn was hired by Inovo to investigate Gulen for Turkish interests. Tim Newberry and Jon Iadonisi co-founded White Canvas Group which shared office space with Flynn. Theres more background in

awarded a contractfor $48,843,831 to Blackhorse Solutions, Inc (global vendor name: White Canvas Group LLC) with an initial payment of $300,000 and an expected completion date of 2024.
The Commercial and Government Entity
(CAGE) Code for Blackhorse Solutionsupdated July 2019, shows the legal business name is White Canvas Group LLC, and the two principals are Tim Newberry and Jon Iadonisi, who both had significant links to Michael Flynn
The $48,843,831
contract for Blackhorse Solutionsis described on the DoD website:
This contract will advance global vigilance, global reach, and global power in the information environment through the application, research, development, and transition of emerging technologies and next-gen solutions. This includes rapid tool development, development of electronic warfare/cyber network attack software and hardware systems, analytical processing, cyber threat avoidance and cyber threat defense, test and evaluation, and to manage the development to ensure projects move forward at a rapid pace, that technical and process innovations incorporated into successive rounds of development. Work will be performed at Herndon, Virginia, and is expected to be completed by Sept. 9, 2024. This award is the result of a competitive acquisition and two offers were received. Fiscal 2019 research, development, test and evaluation funds in the amount of $300,000 are being obligated at time of award.

Ironbark Zinc Ltd (ASX:IBG)
has successfully concluded a Phase I due diligence period with US EXIM Bank and has received a Preliminary Project Letter (PPL) outlining EXIMs intention to extend up to US$657 million in debt funding to Ironbark to cornerstone the development of the Citronen Project in Greenland.
Note further due diligence and EXIM board approval is still required and the company remains in a trading halt until tomorrow morning.
The Citronen Zinc Project has an initial 20-year mine life and the potential to rank as a top 10 global zinc producer.
IBG expects that with an advanced pathway to securing project financing, the project should attract widespread interest from a range of participants seeking to participate in its development.
Turning point for Citronen Project
We are delighted to announce this US EXIM PPL, which marks a genuine turning point in the life of the Citronen Project, with proper recognition of the scale and quality of the asset from the capital markets for arguably the first time, Ironbark managing director Michael Jardine said.
We could not ask for a better prospective cornerstone than US EXIM; they will be an excellent partner for Ironbark and its stakeholders as we move forward into what will be another busy 12 months.
""The interest from a top tier financial institution further validates Citronens status as a Tier 1 zinc project and is a testament to the strong fundamentals offered by Citronen, as the company moves closer to becoming a strategic zinc producer.
We have seen in the last six months, since Ironbark updated its BFS, a substantial shift in perception with respect to zinc and the role it will play in the future.
""Now officially a USGS Critical Mineral, the physical zinc market has also shown a formerly underappreciated tightness and we have seen the price respond in a reasonably sustained fashion in recent months. All these factors are flashing green when considering what a very long-life asset such as Citronen potentially offers the market.
We look forward to updating the market on our progress throughout the first half of 2022, as we finalise our project financing package.
Preliminary Project Letter
EXIM worked with Washington based Greengate LLC, an independent financial advisory firm, to assess Ironbarks application in relation to the development of the Citronen Zinc Project.
It used the initial Phase 1 due diligence process as a pre-requisite for obtaining final approval from the EXIM Bank Board.
Ironbark submitted its loan application in August 2021 and since then US EXIM and its advisers have undertaken considerable due diligence on Citronen.
The prospective credit is not yet binding, however, the Preliminary Project Letter (PPL) signals US EXIMs intent to seriously consider Ironbarks funding application and provides project sponsors with a process and issues list to resolve prior to a formal loan offer.
IBG sees this PPL as a welcome endorsement of the fundamentals of the Citronen Zinc Project.
It comes at a time when zinc consumption is growing as the transition to carbon neutrality gains global traction.
With the amount of debt funding, IBG should need no additional project debt funding if the EXIM facility is successfully closed on the terms outlined in the PPL.
The PPL also provides Ironbark with guidance on key issues for Phase 2 due diligence, including completing further financial, technical, environmental and legal reviews as determined by EXIM Bank (including finalisation of construction arrangements).
Whats next?
Phase 2 due diligence will commence in early 2022 and will be focused on addressing the points raised by US EXIM in the PPL.
Further information will be provided on the key steps and timing of that process, including the means to obtain US EXIM board approval and subsequent drawdown, when confirmed between the parties.
IBG has also started to identify and consider prospective equity investors.

717,"$5,000 reward offered in South Carolina by animal wellness groups for info that leads to cockfighting arrests, convictions","Subscribe today for $2.29 / week
Columbia, SC Animal Wellness Action (AWA) and the Animal Wellness Foundation (AWF) recently announced a $5,000 reward for information resulting in the successful prosecution of any individual for violating state or federal law (7 U.S.C. 2156) against animal fighting. The announcement follows a raid last week in Spartanburg County where authorities arrested three men, and Georgia law enforcement apprehended eight individuals at a cockfight last month.
Prior to the recent Nevada and California incidents, AWA and AWF developed detailed investigations and dossiers on individuals in Alabama, Hawaii, Kentucky, North Carolina, Oklahoma, and Tennessee, and alleged their deep involvement in activities related to cockfighting, with several of them shipping cockfighting birds to Mexico, the Philippines, Guam, and other distant locations. AWA and AWF presented the information to relevant law enforcement agencies and officials, including the U.S. Attorneys representing three jurisdictions in the state.
Federal and state law enforcement have a duty to enforce our laws against the barbaric practices of cockfighting and dogfighting, said Wayne Pacelle, president of Animal Wellness Action. But their good works depend on the cooperation and alertness of citizens. We ask people who know about illegal animal fighting activities to help us stop these forms of cruelty.
The blood-sport of cockfighting breeds a cesspool of illegal activities, such as gambling and drug use, and disease, said Marty Irby, executive director at Animal Wellness Action. We will make the Palmetto State safer when we root out this egregious criminal activity, and we hope the good people of South Carolina will seek our $5,000 reward.
Under the federal anti-animal fighting law, it is a crime to:
Knowingly sponsor or exhibit in an animal fighting venture.
Knowingly attend an animal fighting venture, or knowingly cause an individual who has not attained the age of 16 to attend an animal fighting venture.
Knowingly buy, sell, possess, train, transport, deliver, or receive any animal for purposes of having the animal participate in an animal fighting venture.
Knowingly use the mail service of the U.S. Postal Service, or any written, wire, radio televisions or another form of communications in, or use a facility of, interstate commerce, to advertise an animal for use in an animal fighting venture, or to advertise a knife, gaff, or other sharp instrument designed to be attached to the leg of a bird for us in an animal fighting venture, or to promote or in any other manner further an animal fighting venture except as performed outside the U.S.
Knowingly sell, buy, transport, or deliver in interstate or foreign commerce a knife, a gaff, or any other sharp instrument designed or intended to be attached to the leg of a bird for us in an animal fighting venture.
Penalties for each violation of any one of these provisions allow for a maximum of five years in prison and a $250,000 fine for perpetrators, except for an adult attending an animal fighting venture. Penalties for an adult attendee are one year in prison and a $5,000 fine.
An animal fighting venture involves a fight conducted or to be conducted between at least two animals for purposes of sport, wagering, or entertainment.

When investors think about the health care space, their minds often turn to the companies that own hospitals or to the pharmaceutical companies or to the health care providers. But one area often overlooked involves the HSA, or Health Savings Account. Health Savings Accounts allow workers to set aside money on a pre-tax basis in order to use those funds for healthcare purposes. They are a major tool for millions of Americans that, at the end of the day, help to reduce the burden of America's costly healthcare system. And one company that is dedicated to providing this kind of offering, not to mention other services, is HealthEquity (
HQY
). Over the past few years, the company has exhibited tremendous growth. That growth has continued into the current fiscal year. However, cash flows have been very attractive for the past few years and have been growing alongside revenue. Ultimately, HealthEquity appears to be a high-quality company for investors to consider. But this does not mean that it makes for a great investment prospect. Shares today do look rather pricey and are, at best, fairly valued. More likely than not, they might actually be overpriced to some degree.
A play on healthcare spending
HealthEquity is a diversified providerof various medical offerings and technologies. The core of the company's offerings is the HSA. Based on data covering the final quarter of the company's 2022 fiscal year, it administers nearly 7.21 million HSA accounts worth a combined $19.62 billion. This is up from 5.78 million accounts the company had one year earlier that had a combined value of $14.34 billion. Management has not provided market share data covering the latest fiscal year. But they did say in their most recent annual report that their market share expanded from 4% in 2010 to 16% by the end of 2020. That number is very likely higher today.
In addition to managing HSAs, the company also has another type of account that it oversees called a CDB, or consumer-directed benefits plan. These are offered by employers and include flexible spending accounts and health reimbursement arrangements. At present, the company has 7.19 million of these in its portfolio, up from the 7.03 million it had one year earlier. This brings the total number of accounts the company has to 14.40 million, compared to the 12.81 million it had at the end of its 2021 fiscal year.
As part of its business model, the company also offers technology services that include multiple cloud-based platforms that their members can access online through which individuals can make health savings and spending decisions. Through this online platform, customers can also pay their healthcare bills, look at different treatment options and prices, receive personalized benefit and clinical information, earn various wellness incentives, grow their savings, and even make other investment choices. Much of this functionality came as a result of the company's acquisition of WageWorks in 2019, a deal valued at about $2 billion. In addition to all of this, the company also offers a mutual fund investment platform and provides access to an online-only automated investment advisory service that it makes available to all of its members whose account balances exceed a certain set threshold. Other miscellaneous offerings include COBRA continuation services to employ your clients, health reimbursement arrangements, and even commuter programs that offer their users special pre-tax treatments.
Author - SEC EDGAR Data
Over the past few years, management has done well to grow the business. Although organic growth has taken place, much of this expansion was attributable to its acquisition activities. Between 2018 and 2021, for instance, the company saw revenue climb from $229.5 million to $733.6 million. Official financial results have not been provided for the 2022 fiscal year. But the company has saidthat revenue should range from between $754 million and $756 million. At the midpoint, this would imply a year-over-year growth rate of 2.9%.
When it comes to profitability, the picture has been a bit more volatile. Net income has been all over the map but has been consistently positive for the past few years. What is really exciting, however, has been operating cash flow. Between 2018 and 2020, this number increased from $81.7 million to $181.6 million. Over that same window of time, EBITDA has followed a similar trend, rising from $84.7 million to $240.8 million. Management has provided guidance for the 2022 fiscal year. Based on the data provided, EBITDA should be between $232 million and $235 million. Applying the same year-over-year growth rate to operating cash flow would imply a reading of $176.1 million. And non-GAAP earnings for 2022 should be between $108 million and $110 million.
Author - SEC EDGAR Data
Taking this data, we can effectively price the company. On a price to adjusted earnings basis, the multiple of the company looks to be about 40. The price to operating cash flow multiple is substantially lower but still lofty, coming in at 24.8. And the EV to EBITDA multiple of the company should be about 19.9. Truth be told, these levels are quite lofty no matter how you look at them. And this is true even if you look at them relative to other similar firms On a price-to-earnings basis, the five firms that I identified as being most similar to HealthEquity had a range of between 17.9 and 35.8. Using the price to operating cash flow approach, the range was 8.4 to 23.2. And looking at the pictures of the lens of the EV to EBITDA multiple would give a range of 11.1 to 17.1. In all three cases, HealthEquity was the most expensive of the group. Though it is worth mentioning that these comparable firms are all substantially larger than our prospect. The smallest of them, by market capitalization, is over four times its size. And the largest is almost 101 times its size. Higher trading multiples can be assigned to smaller companies if investors are anticipating rapid growth for an extended period of time. So that expectation may be driving some of this disparity and might be warranted if growth continues.

745,A First Look At The New Tschabalala Self x Ugg Collaboration,"At the Performa Biennial last October, artist [Tschabalala Self](https://www.vogue.com/slideshow/tschabalala-self-on-her-new-exhibition-and-taking-up-space-through-her-artwork){: target=""_blank""} presented her first-ever live performance. Titled *Sounding Board*, the commission  a three-act experimental play staged at the Jackie Robinson Park Bandshell in Harlem, where Self grew up  centred on a dispute between lovers, with a small company of actors (Hunter Bryant, Alexis Cofield, Cj Hart, and Imani Love, all clad in graphic separates and boots) repeating the same dialogue three different ways. A Boney M. cover band took the place of a Greek chorus, while the collaged aesthetic of Selfs canvases  known for picturing Black female bodies in a mixture of paint and scraps of found fabric  was reflected in the set.

Ive always toyed with the idea of one day making a movie or something in that vein, says Self, speaking from her home in New Haven, Connecticut. But when I was asked to come up with a piece for Performa, the first thing that occurred to me was to make some kind of play. The narrative element appealed to her  It seemed like the most accessible way for me to approach performance art, she says  as did the chance to create a Gesamtkunstwerk: Besides writing the script and directing the actors, Self also painted the backdrop and designed the costumes, produced in a special collaboration with Ugg.  I set out on this mission to make sure that I was involved in the aestheticisation of every aspect of it, she says. I wanted it to be a head-to-toe situation.

She was already in the thick of things when Ugg got in touch. With brand collaborations, Im always trying to find innovative ways to fold them into bigger projects that I have, Self says. (In previous years, shes joined forces with the likes of Yoox and Louis Vuitton.) Now, her Ugg X Tschabalala Self capsule collection  which includes some looks from the *Sounding Board* wardrobe  is due to drop next month.



[#image: /photos/621901f94fa01954f302e6bc]

Made up of colourful twists on Uggs boots, slippers, outerwear, and accessories, the edit easily combines form, function, and Selfs exuberant creative vision. It was kind of a natural fit, she says. Ugg is a brand that deals a lot with materiality and texture, and I deal with that stuff in my painting as well.

Still, in other ways the process had her step slightly outside of her usual vernacular  figuration, namely. It proved a refreshing change. With this project, I feel like Im using a lot of the same aesthetic tropes and types of patterning and design and geometry that I would generally use in my practice, but the figure is not present, she notes. I was able to indulge purely in what feels and looks good, as opposed to linking those things directly to a much larger social and political narrative. Her motifs in the capsule include the black and white checks seen in paintings like *KLK* and *Chopped Cheese*, both from 2017, and an irresistibly pretty blue-green wash. I wanted to have one piece that felt very painterly, Self explains.

Elsewhere in the collection, she riffs on the seam that runs down the back, sides, and across the front of most classic Ugg boots. One of the designs repeats the seam throughout the entire shoe, Self says. In my paintings stitch has a utilitarian purpose, because I dont really use any glue for all the assemblage and collage, but I also use stitch to draw and to decorate the figures. So, I was able to do something similar with those shoes. Three heeled boots, two of them artfully colour-blocked, offer up additional examples of Selfs out-of-the-box thinking.

[#image: /photos/621901fbacf0d157cbfebf91]

+++

For the artist, the experiences of creating *Sounding Board* and working on the capsule were similar in their emphases on collaborative thinking. Even before the pandemics enforced isolation, Self often operated on her own. Ive never worked that collaboratively before, in terms of working with so many different people to actualise ideas in my practice, she says. With the kind of art that I make, and running a painting studio, its generally a very solitary experience. So it was great to have that kind of connectivity.



[#article: /articles/6204eaf9be227be7f67d5c6d]

In the end, both processes had the effect of deepening Selfs own ideas about her work. The experience strengthened what I already believed to be true in regards to the repetition and the reiteration of things, she says. Like, realising that if you have an idea and then someone else is asked to interpret it, they are bringing their own creativity and artistic energy to that interpretation  and the idea itself becomes elevated in this really organic way.

748,10 Genesee Co. communities making Medstar only EMS service,"Share on LinkedIn
MUNDY TWP., Mich. (WNEM)-
Ten Genesee County communities have signed on to an exclusive agreement with an emergency medical service provider.
Under the agreement, only Medstar will be able to provide EMS services in these specific areas.
We do have a sizable senior population in Mundy Township. And I know that weighed heavily on a number of our board members, said Mundy Township Manager Chad Young.
Mundy Township is one of numerous Genesee County locations that have exclusivity agreements with Medstar set to begin in 60 days.
Medstar, the way that the agreement is structured, is guaranteeing to us that theyll respond within that nine-minute timeframe 90 percent of the time or greater, Young said.
Medstar CEO Kolby Miller said the ambulance service will use a dynamic deployment model. A method that will promote safety, system design, and ems system effectiveness.
When you staff on a demand model, you place your vehicles where the highest probability of a call is going to be for a safe response. And during the peak times we staff for peak volume. And then during the lower periods of volume request, you staff to cover the geography so that you can continue those safe responses, Miller said.
Miller knows there are some people in Genesee County who have raised concerns over potential lawsuits, liability issues, or longer response time in the case that an ambulance from another company might be closer to the 911 call.
I think that when you design vehicles so that youre preventing 35 and 40- and 50-minute response times that some of the periphery in the county is seeing, and managing all of the response times, you ultimately improve the response time for the system. Rather than just focusing on a 45 second or 50 second difference between one or two of the individual calls and using that as some sort of scare tactic, Miller said.
Young said Mundy Township can opt out of the agreement anytime with 30 days notice. But he hopes that is not necessary.
Were gonna try. Were gonna take a shot at it and see if it does provide a discernible improvement to that quality of service to our residents and community, Young said.

Solutionreach partners with more than 25,000 provider organizations in numerous specialties.

Our mission with SR Health is to be a breath of fresh air in patient engagement for larger organizations by building upon our 20 years of market leadership and connecting patients to their providers across all healthcare specialties.

SR Healths unique approach to patient engagement includes the ability for providers to create flows for a broad spectrum of patient communications.

Communications related to scheduling (appointment confirmations, pre-visit instructions, recalls, etc.), care plans (post-visit surveys, education, etc.), ongoing outreach (marketing campaigns, review requests, etc.), and billing are easily customizable and configurable via the SR Health platform.
While we continue to extend our leadership position among dental, vision, and independent medical practices, the launch of SR Health marks a re-dedication to solving patient engagement challenges for ALL patient-provider environmentsincluding hospitals and large health systems, says Weiner.

779,Colorado BioScience Association taps new leader to guide it forward,"Reporter/Colorado Inno associate editor
Oct 27, 2021
Theres a new leader at the Colorado BioScience Association, and she has her eyes on turning the state into a national powerhouse.
CBSA today announced the appointment of Elyse Blazevichas the new president and CEO of the industry organization. Blazevich comes to CBSA as the company she co-founded and led as chief financial officer and chief operating officer, Securisyn Medical, transitions its leadership team to scale commercially.
Securisyn is a medical device technology company that has developed breathing, smooth tube and catheter securement products.
Blazevich has previously served in a board leadership role with CBSA and replaces former President and CEO Jennifer Jones Patonafter she announced her decision to step downin July. At the time, Jones Paton said she was leaving the role to spend more time with her baby daughter.
In moving on from Securisyns executive team, Blazevich will channel her experience in a wider reaching role.
As a medtech founder and chief executive, I understand what it takes to lead a Colorado life sciences company from concept to commercialization, she said.
Blazevich said she is also excited to accelerate the momentum Colorados bioscience community has experienced in recent years.
The Colorado bioscience industry topped $1 billion in capital 2018, brought in $12.1 billion in 2019 (due to the $11.4 billion acquisition of Array) and a combined $2.6 billion was raised by the industry in 2020. In just the first quarter of 2021, the industry raised $704 million according to CBSA.
Part of this recent jump in capital can be attributed to increased interest from coastal investors, Blazevich said. She hopes to keep that investment success rolling.
With access to capital being a top priority for our members, we need to continue to grow and emphasize the opportunities and success stories that are coming out of Colorado and continue to attract those investments in our state, she said.
Blazevich also wants Colorado to be known as an affordable alternative to traditional coastal life science hubs. In order to build that reputation, she said Colorado has to continue its diversity, equity and inclusion efforts and ensure that the state remains a pro-innovation environment for life sciences companies.
A recent report from JLLranked the Denver-Boulder market among the top 10 bioscience markets in the U.S and Canada, thanks in part to its strong talent and lab real estate.
In its 2021 Life Sciences Real Estate Outlook, JLL analyzed the top life science clusters in North America based on talent, industry depth, innovation and lab real estate dynamics. Denver-Boulder ranked No. 8 on that report.
Despite the strong showing, the report showed that the Denver metro simply does not have enough lab space  which is an industrywide problem. The other challenge the local ecosystem faces is access to talent.
Its important that we need to continue to grow our ability to educate a younger scientific workforce, Eric Brynestad managing director for JLL in Denver, said in a recent interview. That will continue to be a need and a focus, to continue to have that young talent being groomed at sufficient numbers to continue to feed that growth.
As it receives national recognition for its successes, Blazevich has her sights set on a higher target.
I envision Colorado being a top five hub for life sciences, she said.

786,Journal of Dental Clinics,"Invisalign is the leading and pioneering brand in the market, having been around since 1997.
Invisalign teeth aligners can work on more complex cases of teeth alignment.
Cons
Invisalign can be very expensive. They can cost more than what you spend on traditional braces.
SmileDirectClub
People who are looking for quality invisible aligners for a reasonable rate.
Treatment
When approved for treatment, SmileDirectClub will send you a set of invisible aligners. Each one of the aligners will make slight adjustments to the position of your teeth. The orthodontist or dentist assigned to you will notify you whether you should use the next set of aligners or not.
Smile Direct Club also offers exclusive benefits and discounts for teenagers such as video chats and aligner replacements. Parents will also be getting notifications on their teenagers treatment.
SmileDirectClub offers daytime and nighttime aligners. No matter what type of invisible braces you get, you will receive a complimentary Bright On tube, which is the teeth whitening treatment of SmileDirectClub.
Treatment is done remotely and you will stay in touch with the dental team online. You can also reach out to them through phone, website chat, video chat, and email.
Treatment time
You have to wear the daytime aligners for 22 hours a day. And for nighttime aligners, you have to wear them for 10 continuous hours. Most patients can finish their Smile Direct Club treatment within four to six months.

If you do not want to shell out money initially for the kit, you can check if there is a Smile Shop in your location and visit them to have your teeth impressions done for free.
The Smile Direct Club treatment will cost you a one time payment of $1950. There is also a monthly installment plan available where you can pay $89 per month for 24 months ($250 downpayment).
When you are done with your treatment, a customized set of retainers from Smile Direct Club will cost $99.

SmileDirectClub accepts CareCredit, HSA, and FSA. You can also check your insurance provider if they can cover the cost of your SmileDirectClub aligners.
See our full Smile Direct Club review here
Pros and cons
SmileDirectClub has special benefits and discounts available for teenagers who want to straighten their teeth.
Nighttime invisible aligners are available at the same price as daytime aligners.
Cons
SmileDirectClub does not work exclusively with orthodontists. This is not a bad thing if you have a mild case of misalignment with your teeth but if your teeth needs more work, you should look for an orthodontist that is associated with SmileDirectClub.
AlignerCo
People who are looking for the cheapest invisible braces in the market.
Treatment
You start your AlignerCo teeth straightening treatment by ordering an impression kit or do a walk-in to an Aligner Co SmileStudio near you so they can scan your teeth and do the impression for you. You will then have to wait for the aligner trays to be sent to you at home.
The invisible braces are trimmed to the gum line so you should expect it to fit snugly on your teeth. This cut will be more comfortable compared to other clear aligner options in the market.
Treatment is done remotely and if you have any concerns or need to contact your dentist during the treatment, you can contact a Smile Crew Member who will forward your concerns and questions to the dentist assigned to you.
Aligner Co offers both daytime and nighttime clear teeth aligners. This allows you to choose which treatment is most convenient for your schedule or lifestyle.

Tammy Paolino

Think you know all there is to know about the South Jersey dining scene?
Im going to take the bet there is at least one restaurant that has escaped your notice.
Life Caf is one of the more unusual restaurants in our region. For one thing, its positioned in the lobby of a mammoth high-end fitness center. If you arent a member of Life Time Athletic on Church Road in Mount Laurel, theres a good chance you dont know it exists.
But here is the good news. This sparkling whole foods eatery is open for business for the walk-in customer who wants anything from a cup of coffee to a hearty salad to-go to a sit-down, freshly prepared meal. The menu is filled with tempting options breakfast sandwiches, power bowls, salad sandwiches and flatbreads.
And its open for breakfast, lunch and dinner, 6 a.m. to 10 p.m., Monday through Friday.
Some items are already boxed and ready to go after your workout or for quick dash-in for lunch to bring back to your office. Others are made while you wait the Pesto Turkey Burger, for instance, or the Caprese Portobello Flatbread.
The caf itself is modern and chic, but comfortable, with views of a lobby that rivals many top hotels and a front-row seat to people headed in for yoga, a workout or a massage.
For Jacquelyn Butler, manager of Life Caf, this role is a major life change.
Prior to joining the fitness company, the Cherry Hill resident worked for six years for the Cheesecake Factory and its spin-off Grand Luxe Caf.
After giving birth 16 months ago to her first child, Butler was looking for a change that would help her work life come more in line with her life goals.
This was a big change for me, Butler confides. (Cheesecake Factory) is about desserts and large portions, and this is the exact opposite.
Indeed, when she isnt running the caf, Butler can avail herself of the bounty of wellness and fitness options offered by the 102,000-square-foot facility.
Life Time Athletic, which opened in Mount Laurel in October, is part of nationwide chain of luxury fitness complexes that offer everything from diverse fitness classes and yoga to high-end spa treatments, massage, eucalyptus saunas, indoor and outdoor pool facilities. For kids, there are fitness, art and music classes, a play area and summer camp opportunities. The center also hosts Parents Nights Out and is available for private birthday parties.
Life Caf sees lots of action early in the morning, Butler says. We get our surge of warriors in the morning, up at 5 a.m. Families are more likely to come in in the evening, before or after their classes. We cater to a large demographic. Our clientele is very diverse.
A lot of business professionals come in and work out on their lunch break, Butler observes. They can enjoy (lunch) here, or if they want, order something to-go, as well.
The caf, as well as the spa services, are available without a membership. And spa customers can purchase a guest pass to use the entire facility for the day.
Even without venturing beyond the lobby and restaurant, a visit here is a pampering experience.
The cafs walls are a warm, inviting green. And while everything looks and smells yummy, its all good for you.
Its our brand promise, says Butler. If its here, its good for you.
Meals and snacks are prepared without the use of artificial colors, flavors or sweeteners; trans fats, or bleached flour, and without GMOs as much as possible, Butler says.
Although most of the space is devoted to various types of caf seating at high tops and smaller tables, the walls also offer nutritional supplements, power bars and drinks and other items for purchase. WiFi is available for those who want to work right from here.
We partner with different brands in different markets, she says. Were like the healthy Wawa.
There are plentiful options for vegetarians, vegans, as well as Paleo, gluten-free and dairy-free diets.
If you have food allergies or sensitivities, its a good option, as Butler says they can look up every ingredient of everything sold there.
Quinoa salads loaded with fresh ingredients are big sellers, as is a Detox Chicken Breast with quinoa, veggies and a cayenne dressing.
The Glorious Green Salad is stocked with arugula, sweet potatoes, raisins, sliced almonds, apples, goat cheese with a house made tarragon-mustard dressing. You can ask for Life Cafs Super Seed blend on top mix of flax, hemp and sunflower seeds.
It offers a whole bunch of healthy fats, balanced out with the right amount of fiber and the right amount of sweetness, Butler says.
And Butler is a big fan of the flatbreads, which are made with ancient grains and are gluten-free.
But you could not tell, she promises, if I didnt tell you.
Kind of like Life Caf itself. You might not know its there if we didnt tell you.
But now that we have, its worth remembering next time you want a different restaurant experience, without the guilt.
Life Cafe inside Life Time Athletic is located at 3939 Church Road, Mount Laurel. The cafe is located just inside the lobby to the right.

From left to right, Dr Carmen Jimenez, Grant Howard (Burgis & Bullock) and Harry Leak.
A dentist wife and her husband have opened a new dental practice in Husbands Bosworth the first ever in the village.
Dr Carmen Jimenez has thrown open the doors to the private practice on the High Street of the flourishing village near Market Harborough.
And her husband Harry Leak has developed the property through his company KIO Developments.
From left to right, Dr Carmen Jimenez, Harry Leak and Grant Howard (Burgis & Bullock).
The new dental surgery will serve the fast-growing local catchment area of over 4,000 people.
Thrilled Carmen, whos expecting their second child in May, said: There is a great community feeling here in the village and that has only grown with the support everyone has shown each other during the pandemic.
Our family is part of that community and we believe this new surgery will be a valuable resource to other people living in and around Husbands Bosworth.
She added: To open my own practice has always been my goal as my dad had a practice on the ground floor of my house when I was growing up.
It will also be walking distance from home and make it easier for me to spend time with my young family, which is set to grow in May!
Foxbury Dental will create jobs in the village with two nurses, a receptionist, a second and third dentist and a hygienist.
The nearest surgery to Husbands Bosworth previously was eight miles away in Lutterworth.
The new dental health hub is part of a bigger development on the high street by KIO Developments.
The firm has also bought two other properties and will be creating five new flats and renovating an existing cottage.
Harry said: We have been living here for a few years now and identified there was an opportunity to open a practice.
I set up KIO Developments and started looking to acquire premises. We went on to buy three properties on the high street and will be creating new homes for the village too.
He added: There will be two flats above the practice.
Then two doors down we bought another two buildings, one to be converted to three flats and other to be turned into a two-bed cottage.
We are glad to be playing our part in the development of the village.""
As they prepared to open the practice they took expert advice from leading accountancy firm Burgis & Bullock - and Harry will continue to work closely with them as KIO Developments carries on growing.

837,Retirement Strategy: Low-Priced Dividend Investments That Pay Monthly,"MO
).
Lower-priced investments will enable folks with limited funds to either begin or supplement their dividend growth journey in a smaller way, and by the same token enable smaller amounts of cash reserves to ""work"" for some extra income. While having a higher risk profile than cash savings accounts, there are many that seem to be reliable for extended periods of time.
The other appealing attribute of some of these dividend investments is that they pay monthly. I know I always looked forward to a bit of a pop monthly rather than always wait for the quarterly payments. It might even help a bit with your monthly bills!
That said, I have a few monthly dividend CEFs (closed end funds) that have decent yields and are selling at a deep discount to the original NAV. They are well regarded and low priced, and will give you some monthly, rather than quarterly, cash flow.
A Quick Definition Of ""Closed End Funds""
Like a mutual fund
, a closed-end fund has a professional manager overseeing the portfolio and actively buying and selling holding assets. Similar to an exchange-traded fund, it trades like equity, as its price fluctuates throughout the trading day. However, the closed-end fund is unique in that, after its IPO, the fund's parent company issues no additional shares. Nor will the fund itself redeembuy backshares.
One of the unique features of a closed-end fund is how it is priced. The NAV of the fund is calculated regularly. However, the price that it trades for on the exchange is determined entirely by supply and demand. This investor demand can lead to a closed-end fund trading at a premium or a discount to its NAV. A premium price means the price of a share is above the NAV, while a discount is the opposite, below NAV, value.
What I have always tried to do with CEFs is to own them only when they are trading for a significant discount to its NAV. I must also state that CEFs carry a higher expense and fee amount than other investments. However given the generous yields, this really does not bother me, especially when they are discounted to the NAV.
Here Are Several Monthly Dividend Investments I Like
Nuveen High Income 2021 Target Term Fund (
): Current yield: 4.38%, is a CEF that has performed reliably since mid-2016.
Price chart from Fidelity Investments:
Current share price is $8.90 as I write this on June 15, 2020, which represents a discount of roughly 11% from its original NAV of 9.85. The goal of this CEF is to return to shareholders by about Nov. 1, 2021 its original NAV. That obviously means there is a potential 11% capital appreciation potential, while paying a monthly dividend, which as of now was .0315/share.
Objective from
JHB prospectus:
....the Fund intends to utilize various portfolio and cash flow management techniques, including setting aside a portion of its net investment income, possibly retaining gains and limiting the longest maturity of any holding to no later than 1 May 2022.
The fund is invested in junk-grade status for the most part, however the risk for this security is still lower than average (due its very short term maturity term). But there is a risk. I myself believe that this fund will meet its goal, and that shareholders will enjoy monthly dividends for at least the next 16 to 18 months.
Here are the charts per Fidelity Investments:
With 82% of holdings with maturity terms between one and three years, to me the risk is acceptable, especially when one is buying shares at a decent discount to the original NAV. You should decide for yourselves of course.
Nuveen Floating Rate Income Fund (
): Current yield is a lofty 8.90%, which has been paying dividends since 2004 at various rates.
Price chart from Fidelity Investments:
With a current share price of $7.87/share, we are looking at a 40% discount to its 2004 price, however it is now trading at a 14% discount to its original NAV. So I believe that with the discount to its original NAC and a sweet 8.90% yield, now could be the right time to open a position in this security.
It is currently paying .046/share on a monthly basis. I like the risks associated with this CEF as it is paying well to hang on, and with a longer maturity term of the (mostly) corporate bonds held, the reward could be significant. Don't forget, you will be paid monthly!
Objective from the
JFR prospectus
:
The Fund seeks to achieve a high level of current income by investing in a portfolio of adjustable rate senior loans and other debt instruments.At least 80% of its managed assets will consist of adjustable rate loans; at least 65% of these must be senior loans secured by specific collateral. Other loans may include unsecured senior loans and secured and unsecured subordinated loans. The Fund uses leverage.
Reduced interest rate risk: Invests in adjustable rate loans, which are less sensitive to interest rates than most fixed income securities, providing a potential hedge against rising short-term rates.
High income potential: Offers the potential for high monthly income through a portfolio of primarily higher yielding, below investment-grade loans.
Balanced income and risk: Extensive credit expertise and loan market presence enable opportunities to maximize riskadjusted returns.
Here are supportive charts also from Fidelity Investments:
Like every other security, this fund took its hit back in March and it can be owned at the discount noted, which is right where you want to enter a position in a CEF (I wouldn't pay a premium for any CEF). I really like this one! Check it out and see if you like it and the risks (although mitigated) that it carries.
Further digging from Fidelity Investments:
A deeper dive into bond holdings:
94% invested in corporate bonds and the average maturity is four to eight years. Still very attractive in my opinion!
As I mentioned before, at the discount to the original NAV and the reduced interest rate risks, even though there are no ultra-high-quality ratings and there is a relatively small BBB rating, I still believe the reward is worth the risk. Take a look yourselves!

863,"Great American invests in Blue Water, a Cincinnati company with IPO plans","Staff reporter, Cincinnati Business Courier
Jan 6, 2022
The Lindner family and Great American Insurance are known for being tight-lipped about their investments in private companies, but one of their investments was recently disclosed in a regulatory filing submitted by a local company eyeing an IPO.
Downtown-based Great American Insurance Co., the primary subsidiary of publicly traded American Financial Group Inc. (NYSE: AFG), is an investor in Blue Water Vaccines Inc. according to a Securities and Exchange Commission filing. Downtown-based Blue Water is developing a universal flu vaccine.
Great American also is considering buying as much as $1.5 million more stock in Blue Water in the initial public offering, according to Blue Waters SEC filing.
""One of our existing stockholders and its affiliated entities, Great American Insurance Company, has indicated an interest in purchasing an aggregate of up to approximately $1.5 million worth of common stock in this offering at the initial public offering price,"" Blue Water said in the filing.
Great American already owns about 400,000 shares of Blue Water, based on information in the SEC filing.
It will own 5.1% of Blue Waters stock after the IPO if it follows through on its level of interest, Blue Water said in the SEC filing.
Neither Great American nor Blue Water officials could be reached to comment for this story.
American Financial co-CEO Carl Lindner IIIhas told me in the past he doesn't discuss private company investments. Lindner, his brother, co-CEO Craig Lindnerand their family own nearly 20% of American Financial.
Blue Water filed plans in October for its IPO
. It hasn't said when it will complete the deal.
Great American bought 82,000 shares of Blue Water preferred stock in July 2019 for $500,000. Great American Life Insurance bought the same amount at the same price. Its unclear if that ownership interest has since been transferred to Great American Insurance. American Financial sold Great American Life in Mayto Massachusetts Mutual Life Insurance Co., known as MassMutual.
Cincinnati-based startup investor CincyTech owns about 50% of Blue Water through two funds, including Cincinnati Cornerstone Investors. Blue Water CEO Joseph Hernandezowns 37%.
Blue Water plans to raise between $17.8 million and $22 million in its IPO. It said in its SEC filing it plans to offer a little more than 2.2 million shares of at a price somewhere between $8 and$10 a share. The company said it only has cash on hand to fund operations into the second quarter 2022.
As a company thats still developing a product, Blue Water has not yet generated revenue nor is it profitable. Hernandez founded it in October 2018.

NWI Business Ins and Outs: Olive Garden, Anytime Fitness, I Dig Dinos opening; Easter Bunny coming to Southlake Mall
Coming soon
Exterior construction is largely complete on the new Highland Olive Garden, which is tentatively slated to open on May 9.
Olive Garden took over the former Old Country Buffet at 10445 Indianapolis Boulevard in the Highland Grove Shopping Center. The Orlando-based chain of sit-down Italian restaurants has been renovating the 10,179-square-foot restaurant for months.
Highland Building Commissioner Ken Mika said the construction cost an estimated $1.8 million and that materials shortages have delayed the project.
Joseph S. Pete
Delays
Olive Garden was originally eyeing a new location in Schererville's new Oak District, where Chick-fil-A and LongHorn Steakhouse just opened, but opted for Highland a few miles north to more easily obtain a three-way liquor license, typically crucial to a restaurant's profitability.
The chain is known for its pasta, breadsticks, wine and unlimited soup and salad lunch specials.
Owned by Darden Restaurants, Olive Garden has 900 restaurants around the globe, including in Lansing, Michigan City and Hobart at the Southlake Mall.
Joseph S. Pete
Relocating
Anytime Fitness is moving across the street to a much larger 7,400-square-foot location in Winfield that will offer more coaching.
The 24/7 gym chain has been constructing a new two-story gym at the site of the old Evolution Fitness at 7954 E. 108th Ave. for the last seven months. The new gym will feature a 1,080-square-foot purple turf area with state-of-the-art functional training equipment people can work out on in both team training and personalized one-on-one sessions.
At the new location, Anytime Fitness will offer a wide area of team training sessions with MyZone heart rate monitors that track heart rate and calories burned during the workout.

New location
At the new location, Anytime Fitness will offer a wide area of team training sessions with MyZone heart rate monitors that track heart rate and calories burned during the workout.
The Anytime Fitness is owned by Muayad and Vicki Musleh, who have opened nine clubs in Indiana and two in Illinois. The second floor of the new Anytime Fitness will serve as the corporate headquarters for their business, which has 13,000 members.
They also own the Anytime Fitness locations in Dyer, Schererville, Lowell, Crown Point, Cedar Lake and Hobart. The Winfield Anytime Fitness has repeatedly been voted The Times of Northwest Indiana's Best of the Region.
Joseph S. Pete
Opens April 18
Regional Coach Eric White said the brand-new gym is slated to open on April 18.
""It's right across the street from the current location,"" he said. ""It may be Winfield's tallest building. It will be a new coaching club design. It's the only Anytime of its kind. There's no guarantee other new ones will be built this way, but the franchise owner is committed to this new model here.""
Joseph S. Pete
'A lot of cool stuff'
The fitness club will feature equipment like TRX Suspension Trainers, air bikes, row machines, weights, kettlebells, tire flips and sleds.
""There's a lot of cool stuff coming coaches can train the members how to use,"" he said. ""The new MyZone technology shows you on the screen how hard you're working during your workout.""
Members can work out on their own at all hours or sign up for more than 40 team training sessions from Monday through Sunday. Scheduled throughout the day during the week and in the mornings on the weekends, they range from cardio sessions meant to burn calories to weight training sessions meant to build muscle.
Joseph S. Pete
Both gym use and coaching
Between five and 20 people typically work out with a coach each session.
""The goal is to hook people up with a trainer so they're not just signing up for a gym membership. They're getting the education, learning how to use the new stuff out there, and have the benefit of accountability during their workouts,"" White said. ""But what separates us from the F45s, Orange Theories and UFC facilities is we have both gym use and coaching. Clients get the best of both worlds.""

'Our job is to change their life'
Coaching is a big trend in the fitness industry, from Peleton stationary bikes to many of new fitness club concepts opening up.
""We take pride in knowing members by name,"" he said. ""I feel our job is to change their life. We're there to help them achieve the results they're looking for.""

Open
A new interactive and immersive dinosaur, toy and fossil store has brought the Mesozoic era to downtown Griffith.
I Dig Dinos opened Friday in the former An-Dee's Floral space at Main and Broad streets in downtown Griffith. It was most recently occupied by the Power Up Fitness and Training gym.
The space at 100 S. Broad has been transformed into something out of ""Jurassic Park."" It's filled with model dinosaurs, including a huge animatronic Utahraptor in the front window that kids can ride.
Joseph S. Pete
Dinosaur attraction
Business partners Kevin Pete (full disclosure: my younger brother) and Ruben Luna opened the dinosaur attraction, which sells dinosaur products like fossils, collector rocks, space rocks, meteorites, gems, jewelry, toys, figures, figurines, stuffed animals, candy, and graphic novels about dinosaurs, sharks and whales.
There's an explorer section with hardhats, binoculars, magnifying glasses and other archeological tools. It also carries 4D dinosaurs that can be snapped together, dinosaurs that grow when submerged in water, puzzles and science kits with DIY volcanos and tornados.
""It's the kind of things you'd find in a museum gift shop, just way more elaborate,"" Pete said.
Joseph S. Pete
Play paleontologist
I Dig Dinos offers many activities for kids, including a fossil dig, geode-cracking and gold panning to find gems. The hands-on experiences give kids a chance to play paleontologist.
""It's interactive fossil mining where they can fill a bag for $5,"" he said. ""They pick and choose what to take home. It's not a perfectly articulated skeleton like in a kid's museum but it's how it plays out in real life.""
The store is decorated with about 30 dinosaur head mounts and another 30 full-size dinosaur models. It plans to add 40 more in the coming months.

917,Community Health Taps Into Junk-Bond Frenzy to Tame Debt,"Community Health Taps Into Junk-Bond Frenzy to Tame Debt
Paula Seligson
Bloomberg News
BC-Community-Health-Taps-Into-Junk-Bond-Frenzy-to-Tame-Debt                         , Paula Seligson
(Bloomberg) -- Community Health Systems Inc., the debt-laden hospital chain thats been staging a comeback, has more than doubled the size of a bond offering as it takes advantage of some of the lowest yields ever for speculative-grade issuers.
Combined with strong recent earnings results, the company is using the momentum to refinance a high coupon and push out maturities.
Community is selling a $1.8 billion high-yield bond maturing in 2029 and announced a related tender offer Tuesday. The bond offerings size was increased from $750 million due to strong demand from investors.
The company is using the proceeds to buy back its outstanding $1.77 billion of 9.875% junior-priority secured notes due 2023, according to a news release. Meanwhile, pricing discussions on the high-yield bond sale to fund the offer are in the 7% area, according to people familiar with the matter who asked not to be named discussing a private transaction.
Low yields are propelling a busy junk bond calendar that has already seen more than $22 billion of new deals price this month. Yields for CCC rated companies -- the riskiest tier of junk -- stand at 6.7%, the lowest since 2014, according to Bloomberg Barclays index data. Average yields across the index last closed at 4.18%, just two basis points off the all-time low of 4.16%.
That supportive environment is helping companies like Community Health refinance debt at lower rates to lock in savings and chip away at high debt loads. In December, the hospital chain refinanced a portion of its other series of 6.25% notes due 2023 to extend maturities.
The market environment is highly conducive to Community Health extending maturities despite an ongoing pressured fundamental situation, said Mike Holland, a credit analyst at Bloomberg Intelligence. Its distressed story suggests open capital markets often make a more compelling argument than naysayers. A rolling bond gathers no loss.
Low rates across the high yield space, along with strong earnings guidance for 2021, have helped Community Healths bonds recover and make Tuesdays deal possible, but the company still faces high leverage and thin liquidity, Holland added.
Representatives for the company didnt immediately respond to a request for comment. Credit Suisse Group AG, which is leading the bond sale, declined to comment.
Healthcare Struggles
Community Health was once known as one of the most distressed companies in the healthcare sector. But the firm has been selling hospitals to raise cash and refinancing debt to improve its balance sheet. In recent months, the bonds have risen after it reported better-than-expected earnings in the last two quarters.
The company is rated in the riskiest tier of junk debt, CCC+ by S&P Global Ratings and CCC by Fitch Ratings. Moodys Investors Service upgraded the company by one notch to Caa2 on Tuesday and viewed the new transaction as a credit positive event.
Leverage, a key measure of debt to earnings, has been high for years thanks to Community Healths acquisition of rival hospital operator Health Management Associates LLC in 2014, and was 12 times as of Sept. 30, according to a Fitch ratings report released Tuesday. That drops to 8.4 times when considering grants from the CARES Act, Fitch wrote.
The tender is offering 106.5 cents on the dollar for investors who turn in their bonds by 5 p.m. in New York on Feb. 1. The final deadline, with worse terms for participants, is Feb. 16.
The early deadline offer marks a premium compared to where the notes had traded before the tender offer, at 105.5 cents on the dollar on Friday, according to Trace bond pricing data. The notes have since traded up to 106.5 cents.
Community Health Systems new notes are expected to be sold as soon as today, according to people familiar.

918,Tend raises $125M to overhaul the dental care experience,"https://vator.tv/n/5220
The company operates six dental clinics in NYC, and plans to open 20 more this year
While nearly half of Americanssay they don't see a dentist as often as they would like, there's also a sizable percentageof people who avoid going completely. There area variety of reasons they give for that, with over 40 percent citing the cost and more than 30 percent saying they don't need dental care, while 14 percent say they don't have the time, and around 10 percent say they have anxiety over visiting the dentist.
Put together, this shows that people know they need dental care, but they are being held back by a variety of things, from cost to access.
That's the problem being solved by Tend which calls itself ""the first dentist that people actually look forward to."" The company uses technology, including online booking, modern tools, and personalized care, toimprove the patient experience and provide smarter, faster care.
""We've stepped into a $142 billion category that's completely antiquated, known for long wait times, surprise bills, judgment from practitioners and generally unpleasant experiences. We started Tend under the belief that going to the dentist shouldn't feel like it's 1984,""
Doug Hudson
, co-founder and CEO of Tend, told me.
""We have completely modernized and refreshed the experience, making it something that people actually look forward to. Weve launched a suite of products that people are going to be excited about. That's what we're creating here at Tend.""
Tend's solution has caught wind of investors as the company
announced
a $125 million Series C funding led by Addition, with participation from existing investors including GV, Juxtapose, Redpoint and Zigg Capital. With this latest fundraising, Tend now has a total of$198 million.
Launched inOctober 2019,Tend operates its own dental clinics, allowing patients tobook appointments on its online portal, enabling them to not only schedule their visit at a time that's convenient to them, but also to personalize the experience. Patients are able to access their personalized treatment plan through the online portal and connect with clinicians directly in-between visits.
Tend now serves more than 20,000 patients across six locations across
New York City, and e
ach Tend Studio is equipped with screens to visually walk patients through each step of their treatment, along with technology that includes low-noise drills and 20 second pain-free X-ray scans, designed for transparency and precision.
Of course, operating in-person clinics has become more difficult over the last year, as COVID caused a shut down of in-person visits; as such, Tend was forced to close its studios for three months between March and June of 2020.
Since re-opening, it has implemented safety measures that include pre-and-post visit health checks, meaning that before and after a patient comes in, the company will get in touch to ask if they've had any symptoms of illness, or if they've been around anyone sick. It has also implemented contactless check-in, staggered visit times, zero waiting, and a health check on arrival.
""When you arrive, youll be greeted by a team member in gloves and a mask who will take your temperature with a contactless thermometer. If your temperature is within normal range, great. If you show signs of a fever, well ask you to reschedule. Well also ask you again whether youve had any symptoms of illness, or if youve been around anyone sick, in case anything has changed,"" Hudson explained.
With the new investment, Tend says it be launching what it calls ""a suite of comprehensive services and oral care products,"" which willinclude orthodontics through its invisible Breezy Braces, emergency care, oral surgery, and pediatrics. The company also plans to use the new funding to expand, first by opening 20 new locations in New York City this year, before launching into new markets.
The company is looking at the top 20 markets in the US for potential expansion, Hudson said, but its first two new cities will be Washington DC and Boston, with plans to open clinics in both this year.
""We are starting close by in Boston and Washington DC. Both markets behave similarly to NYC and, given their close proximity, we will easily be able to export our teams culture in order to deliver the same best-in-class experience our patients have come to expect,"" said Hudson.
Finally, the company also plans to grow its 256 member team, adding staff across dental, operations and technology.
""We expect that in five years, Tend is the dominant oral care brand that people get excited about. We want people to think of Tend when they think of oral care.""",Z Dental,funding round,expanding geography,executive statement,company description,

Janine Bloor, mother of 14-year-old Eleanor, decided to fundraise for Alice Ward as a thank you for the care the team on the ward provided to her daughter following a T12 spinal cord injury meaning her vertebra was crushed due to extreme compression back in 2018.
The fundraising took place back in 2019 and Eleanor, Janine, with younger sister Charlotte ,visited the Oswestry-based hospital for a follow-up appointment, where they presented the cheque to the RJAH Charity and staff on Alice Ward.
Janine said: The care that Eleanor received throughout her stay on Alice Ward was phenomenal. When she first came to the hospital, she could only wiggle her toes but 12 months on from her injury she learnt to walk again.
Throughout Eleanors stay, her constant and biggest motivation was to be able to ride her horse, Clover, again.
We are all thrilled that we raised 12,000 for Alice Ward we cant believe the positivity, overwhelming kindness and support weve received from our friends, family and work colleagues. I must say a special thank you to JCB and Laboratorios Phergal for their donations.
The Bloor familys fundraising launched with an open day at their company J.A. Bloor Agricultural Services, which raised over 1,600, and concluded with a sponsored family walk in 2019 where over 300 people took part.
Suzanne Marsden, Alice Ward and childrens outpatients manager, said: Im overwhelmed and extremely appreciative to the Bloor family for the unbelievable amount of money theyve donated to us.
Weve already purchased some items for the ward including board games, virtual reality headsets for the children before theatre and during X-rays, and specialist wheelchairs and cushions for children with spinal injuries.
Victoria Sugden, RJAH charity representative, said: Id like to say thank you to Janine, the whole Bloor family and everyone who supported their fundraising efforts the money raised will make a real difference to the experience children and young adults have on Alice Ward.
We have also reserved some of the funds to kickstart another project on Alice Ward, which is very exciting, and we will be able to share more about this shortly.",orthopaedic specialists,funding round,support & philanthropy,executive statement,,
972,Research Centers of America Expedite Broad Study on Moderna's COVID-19 Vaccine,"""), a CenExelCenter of Excellence, joined nearly 100 other clinical research facilities across
the United States
to test the safety and efficacy of Moderna's mRNA-1273 vaccine against COVID-19. The published resultsin
The New England Journal of Medicine
showcased that the trial enrolled 30,420 volunteers and found an overall vaccine efficacy rate of 94.1%. Although moderate, short-lived reactogenicity occurred more often in the mRNA-1273 group, these reactions are typical for vaccinations. Severe adverse events were rare and occurred roughly as often between both the placebo and mRNA-1273 groups.

Dr.
Howard Schwartz
, Chief Medical Officer and Principal Investigator at RCA and a widely-published author, contributed the Center's findings to the study as part of his authoring partnership for the article. ""The data demonstrated strong safety and efficacy results from a novel mRNA COVID-19 vaccine,"" he said. ""These welcome and extremely positive indications are a breath of fresh air after a turbulent year.""
RCA and the entire 5-site CenExel network were uniquely positioned to move this study forward by relying on their profound experience in vaccine research and on-site labs for working with peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC). Professional, full-time staff at these clinical trial facilities have conducted extensive research on vaccines for many viruses already, including seasonal and pandemic influenza, Ebola, smallpox, West Nile Virus, and Zika. The PBMC labs allow for the isolation, cryopreservation, and shipping of PBMC, which is essential for accurate results in a vaccine trial.
""Our whole site network has been able to participate in key studies in Operation Warp Speed,"" said
Tom Wardle
, CenExel CEO. ""In the past several years, our Centers have supported over 100 vaccine trials and surpassed recruitment goals by 110%. We have enrolled over 5,000 patients in six of the seven Operation Warp Speed studies, with 40% of the patients representing diverse minority groups. Throughout these efforts, we maintained the strictest safety measures and the highest quality of work.""
The mRNA-1273 vaccine was developed by Moderna and the Vaccine Research Center at the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID), within the National Institutes of Health (NIH). The study was conducted between late July and October, 2020, with adjustments to the site selection and enrollment processes to maximize racial and ethnic minority representation among volunteers.

In response to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, Family Care Specialists, a medical group providing family medical services in the Los Angeles area, applied for a telehealth expansion grant offered by health payer, Health Net LLC.
Physical distancing has forced many Californians to seek providers that offer telehealth to ease the anxiety of walking into a clinic. However, many providers and organizations, like Family Health Specialists, that serve Medi-Cal patients face financial barriers to expand the implementation of telehealth services, and this is where organizations like Health Net come in.
Recognizing the urgency of the situation, Family Care Specialists, saw the need to increase its telehealth offering to benefit its patients most of whom are coping with a wide array of health issues, but who are also concerned with having to schedule face to face appointments.
""Health Net's investment in telehealth is not only helping safety net providers implement this important technology, it's also helping the underserved,"" said Hector Flores, MD, Family Physician at the clinic's Montebello Office and Co-Director of the Adventist Health White Memorial Family MedicineResidency Program. ""Patients love having this service available because they are not only worried about the pandemic, but child care concerns and transportation can be an obstacle as well. This grant from Health Net will help us develop a strategy to address the digital divide in underserved communities and to bridge the gap in access to culturally and linguistically competent services. We are optimistic about sustaining a telehealth practice well into the future.""

The company had announced$5.9 million in available grants in a Request for Support (RFS) on April 2, 2020. However, based on the overwhelming response to the RFS, Health Net awarded grants totaling $13.4 million.
""Telehealth is proving to be an invaluable resource to treat patients during the coronavirus pandemic,"" said Brian Ternan, President and CEO, Health Net of California and California Health & Wellness. ""From implementing remote patient monitoring to helping underserved communities receive the care they need, these grants will help Family Care Services and safety net providers across California to expand their telehealth efforts.""

1021,Fort Wayne City Council To Discuss Red River Settlement Next Week  WOWO 1190 AM,"WhatsApp
(Photo Supplied/Red River Waste Solutions)
FORT WAYNE, Ind. (WOWO):  Fort Wayne City Council members next week will scrutinize and discuss a proposed agreement with Red River Waste Solutions as the city prepares to transition to a new trash and recycling hauler. According to The Journal Gazette, if the agreement is approved without changes, the city will be able to fine Red River for trash and recycling that is picked up by the city or another service provider from February 1st until June 30th. However, the first $50,000 in fines each month of the transition period, which includes March through June, will be waived.
Red River took over as the citys solid waste service provider at the start of 2018, and residents have reported thousands of missed collections and service issues in the last few years. The Texas company still has a few years on its contract, but the city has said Red River cannot afford to provide trash services for the amount it bid for in 2017. Red River filed for Chapter 11 reorganizational bankruptcy in October.
The city has accepted bids from three potential trash haulers, but the contract cant be awarded until the transition agreement is approved through the bankruptcy court.",FM Solutions,service & product providing,closing,company description,,
2378,STG Divides Its Cigars Portfolio Launches The Forged Cigar Co.,"Punch*
Other Brands
*Notes that this only includes the U.S. distribution rights for these brands, which are separate from the Cuban versions of these cigars.
In addition, the company said that the Forged Cigar Co. could also serve as a distributor for other, third-party brands that are not owned by General Cigar Co.
STG says that it has made a multi-million dollar investment in launching the Forged Cigar Co., notably a commitment to 12 sales reps. The list of sales reps includes a variety of industry veterans: Jared Biocca, Cameron Calhoun, John Gallogly, Nate McIntyre, Dave Mealey and Jim Murray.
It will be led by Sean Hardiman, who has worked for General for the last decade and is now the national sales manager for Forged. In addition, STG says that the Forged Cigar Co. will receive independent marketing and customized programming initiatives.
When we announced last year our withdrawal from the annual PCA Show, we committed to investing funds back into the premium cigar category, said Rgis Broersma, svp of North American Branded and Rest of World division for STG, in a press release. Today, with The Forged Cigar Company, we are doing just that with a multimillion dollar investment in the brick and mortar channel. In having two separate sales companies, we will have more feet on the street to better serve the needs of STGs retail partners, and the ability to be more agile in supporting our current and future brands.
This is not the first time STG has gotten creative and tried a second distribution company. In 2016, it hired a variety of independent sales representatives to sell cigars through Foundry Tobacco Co., which was previously part of the General portfolio. That project lasted about a year and STG ultimately ended up selling Foundry to Kretek International in 2018.",STG International,subsidiary establishment,executive statement,,,
