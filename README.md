**ðŸ“š Multi-label events-focused biotech news classification dataset**

### Key aspects
* Event extraction;
* [Multi-label classification](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multi-label_classification);
* Biotech news domain;
* 31 classes;
* 3140 total number of examples;

### Motivation

Text classification is a widespread task and a foundational step in numerous information extraction pipelines. However, a notable challenge in current NLP research lies in the oversimplification of benchmarking datasets, which predominantly focus on rudimentary tasks such as topic classification or sentiment analysis. 

This dataset is specifically curated to address the limitations of existing benchmarks by incorporating rich and complex content derived from the biotech news domain. It encompasses diverse biotech news articles consisting of various events, offering a more nuanced perspective on information extraction challenges. 

A distinctive feature of this dataset is its emphasis on not only identifying the overarching theme but also extracting information about the target companies associated with the news. This dual-layered approach enhances the dataset's utility for applications that require a deeper understanding of the relationships between events, companies, and the biotech industry as a whole.

### Classes
